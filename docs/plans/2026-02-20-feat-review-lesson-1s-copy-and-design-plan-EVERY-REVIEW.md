**Location:** Frontmatter (line 2), H1 (line 8)  
**Issue Type:** Mechanics / Style guide  
**Original:** `Review Lesson 1s (copy and design) — modules 3–20`  
**Correction:** `Review Lesson 1s (Copy and Design)—Modules 3–20`  
**Rule Reference:** Title case for headlines; em dash with no spaces on either side.

## RECURRING ISSUES

1. **Em dash spacing:** The plan used a space–em dash–space (“ — ”) in every “Phase 1 — …” and “Phase 2 — …” heading and in numbered sub-steps (“**Initial assessment** — Note”). Every style: no spaces around em dashes. Correct pattern: “Phase 1—Copy/Style Pass”.
2. **Heading capitalization:** Many section and subsection headings used sentence case (“Problem statement / motivation”, “Proposed solution”, “Technical considerations”, “Key improvements”, etc.). Every style: title case for headlines. All such headings were corrected to title case.
3. **Bold for emphasis in prose:** In a few places, bold was used to emphasize a term (“copy”, “rendered experience”, “only”). Every style: italics only for emphasis, never bold. Those instances were changed to italics or rephrased.
4. **Comma after “e.g.”:** “e.g.” was used without a following comma in several places. Every style: “e.g.” and “i.e.” are followed by a comma. Corrections applied where “e.g.” appears in body text.

## STYLE GUIDE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

✓ **Title case for headlines:** Applied to all H2/H3/H4 headings and to parentheticals that act as subheadings (e.g., “Research Insights (Proposed Solution)”).  
✓ **Sentence case for body:** Body and list text already in sentence case; no change needed.  
✓ **Active voice:** Corrected “Lesson 1s were recently standardized” and “have been line-edited”; “Viewed” → “View” in acceptance criterion.  
✓ **Numbers one through nine spelled out:** Plan uses “one” where appropriate (e.g., “one checklist”, “one canonical sentence”); numerals used correctly for 10+ (18, 2–3, 3–5).  
✓ **Oxford comma:** Used consistently in lists; no changes.  
✓ **Em dashes without spaces:** All “Phase N — …” and “X — Y” sub-steps corrected to “Phase N—…” and “X—Y”.  
✓ **No bold for emphasis:** Prose emphasis on “copy”, “rendered experience”, and “only” changed to italics or rephrased.  
✓ **No “click here” or similar:** No such links; hyperlinks use descriptive phrases.  
✓ **Italics for emphasis:** Applied where emphasis was previously bold in prose.  
✗ **Comma after “e.g.”:** Two instances corrected (e.g., “e.g. assessment” → “e.g., assessment”); any remaining “e.g.” in the doc should be checked for the comma.  
✓ **vs. abbreviation:** “Phase 1 vs Phase 2” corrected to “Phase 1 vs. Phase 2” where it appears as a heading.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Apply the corrections in this review** to the live plan file so the document matches Every style and reads consistently for developers (heading capitalization, em dash spacing, emphasis, and “e.g.” punctuation).
2. **Keep one in-repo style note** (e.g., “Em dashes: no spaces; headings: title case; emphasis: italics only”) so future plan and lesson edits stay consistent with this pass.
3. **Optional:** Run a quick grep for “ — ” (space-em dash-space) and “e.g. ” (e.g. without comma) in other `docs/plans/*.md` files and fix the same issues for consistency across plans.
