# Brainstorm: Review Lesson 1s (Copy + Design) — Modules 3–20

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Status:** Draft  
**Scope:** LR modules 3–20, Lesson 1 (Introduction) only.

---

## What We're Building

A **combined review** of the 18 standardized Lesson 1 intros (modules 3–20):

1. **Copy / style pass** — Line-edit all intro copy (goal callout, context line, Introduction, Common Question Stems, Core Concepts) for grammar, punctuation, tone, and style-guide compliance. Apply Every-style principles (active voice, no em dashes, consistent lists, etc.) while keeping course-appropriate conventions (e.g. bold for terms, quoted question stems).
2. **Visual / design pass** — Review how these Lesson 1s render in the app (goal callout, typography, spacing, section hierarchy) and propose or implement refinements so the experience feels intentionally designed rather than generic.

**Outcome:** Polished, consistent Lesson 1s that read well and present with a clear visual hierarchy. Modules 1 and 2 are out of scope; only the 18 files in M3–20 are reviewed.

## Why This Approach

**Approach A: Copy first, then design (recommended)**  
Do a full style-edit pass on all 18 Lesson 1s and apply edits. Then review the rendered lessons and document (or implement) design tweaks—e.g. goal callout styling, vertical rhythm, or Compact-theme refinements.  
**Pros:** Clean copy before judging layout; style applied consistently. **Cons:** Two sequential phases. **Best when:** You want copy locked before investing in visual tweaks.

**Approach B: Design first, then copy**  
Define and implement design refinements for Lesson 1 presentation, then line-edit all 18 for style.  
**Pros:** Visual standard set first. **Cons:** Copy might need small reflows if design changes affect space. **Best when:** Layout/UX issues are the main concern.

**Approach C: Single combined review**  
One pass per lesson (or batch): reviewer checks both copy and presentation and produces one list of content edits + design notes; then implement.  
**Pros:** One review round. **Cons:** Heavier per lesson; risk of mixing concerns. **Best when:** Same person does both and wants a single deliverable.

**Choice:** **Approach A.** Copy is the bulk of the content; fixing prose first makes the design review more meaningful and avoids re-editing after layout changes.

## Key Decisions

- **Scope:** Modules **3–20** only (18 Lesson 1 files). Module 1 and 2 unchanged.
- **Review type:** **Both** — (1) copy/style pass using Every-style principles, (2) visual/design pass on rendered Lesson 1s.
- **Order:** Copy first, then design (so layout is judged against final prose).
- **Style guide:** Apply Every-style (grammar, punctuation, active voice, no em dashes, list consistency). Preserve course conventions: bold/italics for LSAT terms, quoted question stems, and existing structure (goal callout, context line, h2 sections).
- **Design scope:** Refinements only—no full redesign. Focus on hierarchy, spacing, and goal-callout treatment within current Compact theme / LessonViewer.

## Open Questions

- None.

---

## Resolved Questions

- **Review type:** Both copy and design (user chose option 3).
- **Scope:** Only modules 3–20 (user specified "Only 3-20").

## Next Steps

- Run `/workflows:plan` to produce an implementation plan (e.g. copy-edit checklist, style rules, design-review checklist, and any theme/component tweaks).
