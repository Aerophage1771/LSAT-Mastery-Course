    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This drill tackles a high-difficulty Most Strongly Supported question. The challenge here is not a simple synthesis of facts, but rather a more complex deduction based on constraints. You must use the limits established by the stimulus—specifically, a superlative (\"purest\") and a restriction (\"never\")—to infer the properties of a group that is never explicitly described. This is the skill of reasoning into the \"negative space.\"" },

The mints could refine gold and produced other kinds of coins that had much purer gold content, but the Senegalese gold was never refined." },
