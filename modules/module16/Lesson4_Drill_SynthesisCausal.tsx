The stimulus gave you a concrete example: *making books easier to find caused demand to increase*. The correct answer is the underlying rule this example illustrates: *ease of access affects demand*. Your strategy should be to identify the specific relationship in the text and then look for the answer choice that describes that same relationship in broader, more general terms." }
