The author hears a claim that a certain factor was **necessary** (required) for an outcome, but mistakenly interprets it as a claim that the factor was **sufficient** (a guarantee) for that outcome. The author then `disproves` this misinterpretation and declares victory." },

      "**Find the Logical Gap:** To disprove a claim of necessity, the author would need a species that *survived without* the coping ability. Instead, the author provides a species that *had the Coping Ability but did not Survive*. This only proves the coping ability is not *sufficient* to guarantee survival. The author has attacked a claim (sufficiency) that the anthropologists never made.",
      "**Articulate the Flaw and Prephrase:** The argument misunderstands the anthropologists' claim. It treats a claim about a necessary condition as if it were a claim about a sufficient condition and then refutes that misconstrued claim. **Prephrase:** The author confuses a necessary condition with a sufficient one.",
