      "**Find the Logical Gap:** The argument makes a huge leap from evidence about *some* wealthy people to a rule for *all* wealthy people. The conclusion that `no wealthy person` should be appointed is an absolute ban on an entire group. The only evidence for this ban is that a few members of that group have been criminals. The argument uses a small, potentially unrepresentative sample to condemn an entire category of people. The `number of` criminals could be just a few bad apples, or `exceptional cases,` that do not reflect the character of the group as a whole.",
      "**Articulate the Flaw and Prephrase:** The argument overgeneralizes from a few bad examples. It assumes that because some wealthy people are unethical, all wealthy people are unsuitable. **Prephrase:** The argument makes a broad generalization from a small or unrepresentative sample.",

This often signals a hasty generalization.\n\nQuestion the Sample: Whenever an argument uses a subgroup to make a point about a larger group, ask yourself if that subgroup is truly representative. Look for reasons why the sample might be biased.\n\n`Generalizes` is a Key Word: Answer choices that use the word `generalizes` are often describing this type of flaw. Check if the argument moves from a specific case or a small group to a broad conclusion."}
