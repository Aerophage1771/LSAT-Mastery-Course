The correct answer choice will be an abstract description of one of these errors. Think of this section as a spotter's guide for the most common species of logical flaws tested on the LSAT." },
    { type: 'hr' },
    { type: 'h4', text: '1. Overlooking Possibilities (The "What If?" Flaw)' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This is the most common type of flaw. The argument assumes its explanation is the only one, or its options are the only ones, and fails to consider a plausible alternative. The conclusion is unproven because the author hasn't ruled out other ways the evidence could be explained." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'How to Spot It: The argument will present a scenario and then jump to a single conclusion, often a causal one. Ask yourself: ""Is there any other way this could have happened?""' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Answer Choice Language: `fails to consider`, `overlooks the possibility that`, `ignores the possibility that`." },

        { title: 'Alternative Cause', text: 'The argument assumes one cause led to an effect, ignoring other potential causes. *Ex: ""The crime rate dropped after the new police chief was hired, so the chief must be effective."" (Flaw: Ignores that the economy also improved at the same time).*' },
        { title: 'Alternative Explanation', text: 'The argument provides one interpretation of evidence, ignoring other ways to explain the same facts. *Ex: ""The study showed the new drug didn\'t work. The flaw is that the study might have been too short to see the effects.""*' },
        { title: 'False Dilemma', text: 'The argument presents only two options as if they are the only ones, then eliminates one to force a conclusion. *Ex: ""We must either cut social programs or face bankruptcy. Since we can\'t face bankruptcy, we must cut the programs."" (Flaw: Ignores other options like raising taxes).*' },
        { title: 'Partial Solution', text: 'The argument rejects a plan because it won\'t solve the problem completely, ignoring that it might still be beneficial. *Ex: ""This seatbelt law won\'t stop all traffic fatalities, so it\'s a bad law."" (Flaw: Ignores that it might still save many lives).*' }

    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The argument misinterprets or misapplies an ""if-then"" rule. These flaws are formal and absolute—the reasoning is structurally invalid.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "How to Spot It: Look for keywords like `if`, `then`, `only if`, `unless`, `requires`, `all`, or `any`. The argument will state a rule and then draw an incorrect conclusion from it." },

        { title: 'Mistaken Reversal', text: 'From ""If A, then B,"" the argument wrongly concludes ""If B, then A."" *Ex: ""All dogs are mammals. Fido is a mammal, so Fido must be a dog.""*' },
        { title: 'Mistaken Negation', text: 'From ""If A, then B,"" the argument wrongly concludes ""If not A, then not B."" *Ex: ""If it rains, the ground is wet. It is not raining, so the ground is not wet.""*' },
        { title: 'Confusing Necessary & Sufficient', text: 'The argument treats a required condition (necessary) as if it were a guarantee (sufficient), or vice versa. *Ex: ""To get an A, you must study. I studied, so I will get an A."" (Mistakes a necessary condition for a sufficient one).*' }

    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'How to Spot It: The argument will observe that two things happen together or in sequence and then conclude one caused the other. Look for causal language in the conclusion: `causes`, `leads to`, `results from`.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Answer Choice Language: `infers a cause from a mere correlation`, `fails to consider that the cause and effect may be reversed`, `overlooks a third factor`." },

        { title: 'Correlation for Causation', text: 'The argument assumes that because X and Y happen together, X must cause Y. *Ex: ""Ice cream sales and crime rates are both highest in the summer. Therefore, eating ice cream causes crime.""*' },
        { title: 'Reversed Causality', text: 'The argument correctly identifies a causal relationship but gets the direction wrong. *Ex: ""People with positive attitudes are more successful. Therefore, a positive attitude causes success."" (Flaw: Ignores that success might cause a positive attitude).*' },
        { title: 'Ignoring a Common Cause', text: 'The argument misses that a third factor, Z, could be the cause of both X and Y. *Ex: ""Students who get tutoring have lower grades. Therefore, tutoring hurts academic performance."" (Flaw: Ignores that struggling in the first place causes both the need for tutoring and the low grades).*' }

    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The argument uses statistical evidence incorrectly. This can involve generalizing from a bad sample or misinterpreting a statistic.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'How to Spot It: The argument will cite a study, survey, average, number, or percentage as its primary evidence.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Answer Choice Language: `sample`, `representative`, `generalizes`, `numbers`, `percentages`, `average`." },
    { type: 'breakdown', labels: { title: 'Sub-Type', text: 'Function & Example' }, items: [
        { title: 'Unrepresentative Sample', text: 'The conclusion is about a broad group, but the evidence comes from a small or biased subgroup. *Ex: ""Everyone I know voted for Candidate X, so Candidate X will win the election.""*' },
        { title: 'Numbers vs. Percentages', text: 'The argument uses a raw number to draw a conclusion about a rate, or vice versa, ignoring the overall context. *Ex: ""More car accidents happen within 25 miles of home than anywhere else. Therefore, it is safer to drive far from home."" (Flaw: Ignores that most driving occurs within 25 miles of home).*' },
        { title: 'Part-to-Whole', text: 'Assumes that because the parts of something have a property, the whole must also have it. *Ex: ""Every player on this team is a star, so this must be the best team.""*' },
        { title: 'Whole-to-Part', text: 'Assumes that because the whole has a property, each individual part must also have it. *Ex: ""Our company is environmentally friendly, so every employee must be an environmentalist.""*' }

    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The argument tries to prove a point by attacking an opposing argument or person, often in an irrelevant or unfair way.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'How to Spot It: The stimulus is usually a dialogue or a refutation of a claim made by "some people" or "critics."' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Answer Choice Language: `attacks the source`, `rejects a claim`, `misinterprets`." },
    { type: 'breakdown', labels: { title: 'Sub-Type', text: 'Function & Example' }, items: [
        { title: 'Ad Hominem (Source Attack)', text: 'The argument attacks the person or source making a claim, rather than the claim itself. *Ex: ""You can\'t trust my opponent\'s tax plan. He was caught cheating on his own taxes once.""*' },
        { title: 'Straw Man', text: 'The argument misrepresents or exaggerates an opponent\'s position to make it easier to attack. *Ex: ""My opponent wants to cut military spending. So she wants to leave our country completely defenseless.""*' },
        { title: 'Rejecting Conclusion from a Bad Argument', text: 'The argument concludes a claim must be false simply because the reasoning used to support it was flawed. *Ex: ""My opponent\'s argument for X is based on a bad study. Therefore, X must be false.""*' }

    { type: 'hr' },
    { type: 'h4', text: '6. Equivocation & Language Flaws (The "Word Game" Flaw)' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The argument\'s validity depends on a key word or phrase being used in two different senses.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'How to Spot It: Look for a key term that is repeated, where its meaning could plausibly shift from a premise to the conclusion.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Answer Choice Language: `ambiguous`, `two different senses/meanings`, `misinterprets a key word`." },
    { type: 'blockquote', text: '*Example: ""Feathers are light, and what is light cannot be dark. Therefore, feathers cannot be dark.""* (The argument confuses ""light"" in weight with ""light"" in color).'}
