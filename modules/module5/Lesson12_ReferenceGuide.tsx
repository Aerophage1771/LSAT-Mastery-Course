        "**The `Out of Scope` Trap:** *Why it's tempting:* It raises a valid real-world point that seems related to the topic. *How to Avoid:* Check if the point actually affects the *logical connection* between the premises and the specific conclusion.",
        "**The `Wrong Flaw` Trap:** *Why it's tempting:* It perfectly describes a classic logical fallacy using familiar language. *How to Avoid:* Don't just pick a recognized flaw type. Verify that the argument *actually* committed that specific error.",
        "**The `Premise Attack` Trap:** *Why it's tempting:* It questions the truth or support for a premise, which often feels weak. *How to Avoid:* Accept the premises as true. The flaw is in the reasoning *from* the premises, not the premises themselves.",
        "**The `Reverse Logic` Trap:** *Why it's tempting:* It describes the right family of flaw but reverses the direction. *How to Avoid:* Map the logic carefully. Ensure the answer choice describes the exact direction of the error."
