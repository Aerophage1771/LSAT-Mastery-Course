      "**Find the Logical Gap:** The argument uses a premise about the **total number** of accidents to draw a conclusion about how **accident-prone** each group is. `Accident-prone` is a measure of risk or rate. To compare the accident *rate* of the two groups, we can't just look at the total number of accidents. We need to know the **total number of people in each group**. The population of right-handed people is vastly larger than the population of left-handed people (roughly 9 to 1). So, even if left-handed people were individually much clumsier, the sheer number of right-handed people would likely lead to a higher total number of accidents caused by them.",
      "**Articulate the Flaw and Prephrase:** The argument wrongly uses absolute numbers to draw a conclusion about a rate. It fails to consider that there are far more right-handed people than left-handed people. **Prephrase:** The argument ignores the fact that the two groups are different sizes.",

    { type: 'callout', title: 'Key Takeaways', variant: 'summary', text: "Be Wary of Numbers and Percentages: When an argument uses statistics, always check to see if it's confusing absolute numbers with rates, percentages, or proportions.\n\nContext is King: When comparing two groups, always ask, `Are these groups of a similar size?`\n\n`More` vs. `More Likely`: Pay close attention to this distinction. A higher total number of events (`more`) in a group does not automatically mean that an individual member of that group is `more likely` to experience that event."}
