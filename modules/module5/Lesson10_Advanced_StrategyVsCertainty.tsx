      "**Find the Logical Gap:** The flaw is the assumption that a path leading to a guaranteed outcome is the most likely path to success. **What if** *trying* to create a pure free market is extremely difficult and has a very low chance of success? For instance, it might require a massive political upheaval with a 90% chance of failure. In that case, pursuing a different, less certain path (like gradual reforms) might be the `most likely` way to achieve the goal, even if it doesn't offer a 100% guarantee.",
      "**Articulate the Flaw and Prephrase:** The argument wrongly assumes that the strategy aimed at the `best possible outcome` is also the `most probable` strategy for success. **Prephrase:** The argument assumes that aiming for the guaranteed method is the same as choosing the most likely method.",
