    { type: 'paragraph', text: "You have now mastered the foundational flaw types. However, on the most difficult questions, the LSAT uses sophisticated camouflage to hide the correct answer and make incorrect answers look appealing." },

    { type: 'h3', text: '1. Stimulus Complexity: Hybrid and Abstract Logic' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Hard stimuli often do not fit neatly into one category. They blur the lines between different types of reasoning to disorient you." },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      "**The Causal-Conditional Blur:** Hard questions often mix causal language (`promotes,` `leads to`) with conditional structure (`requires,` `unless`). The flaw might be a causal error hidden in conditional phrasing, or a conditional error hidden in causal phrasing. You must strip the argument down to its skeleton to see if the author is arguing about *physics* (cause/effect) or *logic* (sufficiency/necessity).",
      "**The `Net Effect` Trap:** Arguments that weigh pros and cons often commit a specific type of flaw: assuming that a change in *one factor* guarantees a change in the *overall outcome*. (e.g., `This policy reduces costs, therefore profits will rise`—ignoring that the policy might also reduce revenue)."

      "**In Conditional Logic:** If the stimulus commits a *Mistaken Reversal* (taking a Necessary condition as Sufficient), the trap answer will describe a *Mistaken Negation*.",
      "**In Part/Whole Logic:** If the stimulus assumes a *whole* has the properties of its *parts* (Composition), the trap answer will claim it assumes the *parts* have the properties of the *whole* (Division).",
      "**Why it works:** You recognize the `family` of the error (e.g., `It\'s a part-to-whole thing!`), but if you don\'t map the direction of the inference precisely, you will pick the mirror image of the correct answer."

    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The LSAT loves to offer a `Causal` answer choice for a `Conditional` flaw, and vice versa.' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      "**The Setup:** The stimulus uses conditional language: `To be successful, one **must** work hard.` (Necessary Condition). The conclusion says: `Ted worked hard, so he will be successful.` (Mistaking Necessary for Sufficient).",
      "**The Trap:** `The argument infers that one event causes another simply because they are correlated.`",
      "**Why it works:** Both the correct flaw and the trap describe `bad reasoning based on a link.` However, the relationship in the stimulus is logical (requirements), not physical (causation). You must demand that the answer choice matches the *type* of reasoning used."

      "**The Trap Language:** `The argument fails to establish that [Premise X] is true` or `The argument relies on a claim for which no support is provided.`",
      "**Why it works:** Often, the premises *are* shaky opinions or weak survey results. You naturally want to attack them.",
      "**The Reality:** Unless the prompt explicitly asks about the *use of evidence*, attacking a premise is rarely the correct path for a Flaw question. The Logical Gap is almost always located **after** the premises are accepted. If the answer attacks the starting point, it misses the reasoning error."

Translate `a condition required` into `Necessary Condition.` Translate `a state of affairs` into the specific topic of the stimulus. Concrete translation is the only way to verify if the abstract description matches the specific argument." }
