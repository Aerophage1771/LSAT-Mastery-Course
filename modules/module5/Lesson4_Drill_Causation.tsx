      "**Find the Logical Gap:** The argument observes a correlation and concludes it must be a specific causal relationship (VCR ownership -> more theater visits). The gap is the failure to consider other possible explanations for this correlation. What if a third factor causes both? What kind of person owns a VCR *and* goes to the movies a lot? A movie lover! Someone who is very interested in movies would be more likely to own a VCR for home viewing and also more likely to go to the theater to see new releases. This is a very plausible alternative explanation.",
      "**Articulate the Flaw and Prephrase:** The argument assumes a causal link just because two things are correlated. It fails to consider a third factor—loving movies—that could be the real cause of both phenomena. **Prephrase:** The argument overlooks the possibility that a third factor (like being a movie enthusiast) causes both VCR ownership and frequent movie-going.",
