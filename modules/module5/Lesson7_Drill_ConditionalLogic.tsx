      "**Find the Logical Gap:** The argument perfectly matches the flawed structure of a Mistaken Reversal. It establishes that an unplugged mouse is *one way* (a sufficient cause) for the software to become unusable. It then observes that the software is unusable and leaps to the conclusion that this *must be* the reason. The argument fails to consider alternative causes. The mouse could be broken, the software could have crashed, the computer's USB port could be faulty, or the program could have a bug. The argument wrongly treats one possible cause as the only possible cause.",
      "**Articulate the Flaw and Prephrase:** The argument confuses something that is enough to cause a problem with something that is required to cause it. It treats a sufficient condition (unplugging the mouse) as if it were a necessary one. **Prephrase:** The argument assumes that because an unplugged mouse is one way to cause the problem, it must be the only way.",

If other causes are possible, the argument is flawed."}
