    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**From Description to Evaluation**\n\nFlaw questions represent a critical turning point in your Logical Reasoning journey. After learning to *describe* arguments (Method of Reasoning), your task now shifts to **evaluating** them. You must identify the specific logical error—the ""flaw""—that makes the author’s conclusion suspect.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'As the most frequently tested question type in the section, mastering flaw detection is essential. Success requires a firm grasp of argument structure because you cannot find the error in a line of reasoning until you first understand what that reasoning is. You are looking for the hole in the argument\'s armor.' },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**The Logical Gap**\n\nThe most important concept for Flaw questions is the **Logical Gap**. The flaw is *never* that a premise is factually untrue. Instead, it is the faulty reasoning that fails to bridge the gap between the evidence (premises) and the claim (conclusion). The flaw lies in the **unwarranted assumptions** the author makes when using the evidence to jump to a conclusion.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**Accepting the Premises**\n\nTo find this gap, you must follow a critical rule: **provisionally accept the premises as true.** Do not waste time arguing with the stated facts. Instead, focus entirely on the *relationship* between those facts and the conclusion.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**Fact vs. Interpretation**\n\nWhile you accept the *facts*, you must question the *interpretation* of those facts.' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**What you accept:** The literal statement of the premise. If the author says, """"A recent study showed X,"""" you must accept that such a study exists and its results showed X.',
      '**What you question:** The **probative value** of that premise. You are free to ask: Does this study actually prove the author\'s main point? Does the evidence lead to only one possible conclusion, or is there another explanation for the results?'

    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The key test is always: **""""Even if I accept all these premises as 100% true, is the conclusion guaranteed to be true?""""** If the answer is """"No,"""" the reason *why* is the flaw.' }
