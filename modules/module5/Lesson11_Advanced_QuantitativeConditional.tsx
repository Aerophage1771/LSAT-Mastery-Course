(Necessary condition).\n*   **Conclusion:** More people believe officials should resign **if** indicted than believe they should resign **if** convicted.",
      "**Find the Logical Gap:** The conclusion compares two groups based on `if` statements. However, the second premise doesn't tell us about the `if convicted` group; it tells us about the `only if convicted` group. The argument takes the 35% who believe conviction is *required* (`only if`) and treats them as the total number of people who believe conviction is *sufficient* (`if`). In reality, the `if convicted` group is likely huge, making the conclusion false.",
      "**Articulate the Flaw and Prephrase:** The argument confuses a necessary condition (`only if`) with a sufficient condition (`if`). **Prephrase:** The argument mistakes the `only if convicted` group for the `if convicted` group.",

These are not the same belief.\n\nWatch for Comparisons: When an argument compares the sizes of two groups, ensure the definitions of those groups haven't shifted from the premises to the conclusion."}
