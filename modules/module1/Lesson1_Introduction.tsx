    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Argument Part questions are well-named: they ask you to determine what *part* a specific sentence plays within the author's overall *argument*. This question type, along with Main Conclusion, composes the most fundamental skill in Logical Reasoning: identifying argument structure. Nearly every other argumentative question—from Flaw to Strengthen, Weaken to Assumption—requires you to first understand the parts of an argument and how they work together. Mastering this skill is key to unlocking the rest of the section." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Unlike Main Conclusion questions, which always ask for the final point, Argument Part questions can ask about *any* sentence in the stimulus. You must look past the content of the statement (what it says) to understand its function (what it does)." },

      '**Main Conclusion:** The ultimate point the entire argument is trying to prove. Every other sentence in the stimulus exists to support this claim.',

      '**Intermediate (Subsidiary) Conclusion:** A statement that acts as a bridge. It is supported by premises, but it also supports the main conclusion. It is both a conclusion (because it has evidence) and a premise (because it supports the final point).',
      '**Opposing Viewpoint:** A claim made by someone other than the author (e.g., "Some critics argue...") that the author intends to disprove or criticize.',
      '**Concession:** A point the author admits is true, even though it seems to go against their main argument. This is often used to show reasonableness before pivoting to the main point (e.g., "While it is true that...").'
