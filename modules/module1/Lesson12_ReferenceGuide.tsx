      { title: 'Intermediate Conclusion (11%)', text: '**Function:** A bridge. Receives support and gives support.\n**How to Spot It:** Look for two-step logic. A "because" leads *to* it, and a "therefore" leads *from* it.' },
      { title: 'Opposing Viewpoint (8%)', text: '**Function:** A claim held by others that the author\'s argument is designed to refute.\n**How to Spot It:** Attribution + pivot: "Some claim... **But/However**, this is false."' },
      { title: 'Context / Framing (9%)', text: '**Function:** Sets the stage. Logically separate from the core proof.\n**How to Spot It:** Undisputed facts at the start. Phrasing like, "It has been noted that..."' },
      { title: 'Concession (5%)', text: '**Function:** A point the author acknowledges as true, even though it seems to weaken their own conclusion.\n**How to Spot It:** Concession indicator + pivot: "**Although/While** [this is true]... **yet/but** [my conclusion holds]."' },
      { title: 'Hypothetical Alternative', text: '**Function:** An action that was *not* taken, used as a standard to judge motivation.\n**How to Spot It:** Conditional language: "If the city *really wanted* safety, it *would have* built bike lanes."' }

      '**The Mischaracterization:** The answer uses the wrong label for the argument\'s goal (e.g., "solving a problem" for a refutation). *Avoid by paying attention to the type of argument.*'
