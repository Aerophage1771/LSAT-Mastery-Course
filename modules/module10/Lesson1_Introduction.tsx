The conclusion, as stated, does not necessarily follow from the premises provided. The argument might be decent or even convincing to you; however, there is enough of a gap between the premises and conclusion that someone could reasonably disagree. Your task is to find the missing piece: an unstated premise that, when added to the argument, makes the conclusion logically airtight.' },

The goal is to make the argument airtight, ensuring the conclusion is 100% guaranteed once you add the correct answer.' },
