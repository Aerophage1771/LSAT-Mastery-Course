The argument is flawed because it assumes that the reasons it discusses are the *only* reasons that exist. To make the argument sufficient, you must find an answer that makes the stated list of reasons exhaustive." },

It takes a limited set of rules from the evidence and declares them to be the *complete* set of rules for the situation. This eliminates all other unstated possibilities and makes the conclusion a logical certainty." },

No.\n- Does she meet Condition 2 (petrochemical board)? No, she is on a timber board.\nSo, according to the association's rules, Cecile is not required to disclose.",
