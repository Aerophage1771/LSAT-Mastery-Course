It will take the specific details of the situation and turn them into a broad, universal law. The correct answer will often sound extreme or overly simplistic, but its job is to make the conclusion a logical certainty, not to be a nuanced observation about the real world." },

Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books.

What if Checkers has a strict \"no outside coupons\" policy for accounting reasons? What if they felt accepting the coupons would legitimize their main competitor? The argument assumes that once you eliminate immediate financial self-interest, the only remaining explanation is the desire to harm a rival." },
