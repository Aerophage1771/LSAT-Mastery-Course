This means it must be impossible for one thing to be in both groups at the same time." },

The author assumes a book cannot be both a \"great dramatic novel\" and \"science fiction.\" The evidence only says science fiction \"generally lacks\" these characters. This means some science fiction books might have them. If *The Time Machine* is a science fiction book that *does* have great characters, the author's argument fails." },
