      '**Translate into Simple Terms:** Paraphrase the argument\'s logic using simple, consistent terms. Strip away the fluff and focus on the core concepts.\n    *   Example: “The author uses a study about athletes to prove the general benefit of exercise.”',
      '**Diagram Conditional Logic (Optional):** If the argument uses conditional logic (statements like ""if,"" ""only if,"" ""requires,"" ""must""), diagramming can be helpful. Create a visual chain of reasoning (e.g., A → B → C) to clearly see the flow.'

    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Look for ""New Terms"":** A common pattern is for a new term to appear in the conclusion. The gap is the missing link between a term in the premises and this new term.\n    *   Example: Premise: All A are B. Conclusion: All A are C. Gap: The argument assumes a link between B and C.',
      '**Look for Logical Leaps:** The argument might use the same terms but make an unjustified leap.\n    *   Example: Premise: The plan has a potential negative side effect. Conclusion: The plan should not be adopted. Gap: The argument assumes this side effect is bad enough to warrant rejecting the entire plan.'

    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'If you are unsure, use a process of elimination based on common trap types. A sufficient assumption must be a perfect logical bridge, so any answer choice with a flaw can be eliminated with confidence.' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Trap: Mistaken Reversal/Negation:** The answer choice uses the right terms but connects them in the wrong logical direction (e.g., you need A → B, but the answer gives B → A).',
      '**Trap: The Restatement:** The answer choice simply paraphrases a premise or an intermediate conclusion that can already be derived from the premises. It adds no new bridge in the argument.',
      '**Trap: Support but Not Sufficient:** The answer choice is a statement that is probably true if the conclusion is true, but it doesn\'t *guarantee* the conclusion. These are often weaker statements using words like ""some,"" ""can,"" or ""sometimes"" (May not be a problem if the conclusion is equally weak).',
      '**Trap: Out of Scope:** The answer introduces a new concept that is irrelevant to the core logical structure of the argument.'
