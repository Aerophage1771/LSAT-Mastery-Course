`**"The current crisis... must be overcome IF we are to remain competitive..."**
The word IF is a sufficient condition indicator. Whatever immediately follows "if" is the trigger. Here, "we are to remain competitive" is the sufficient condition, making "crisis must be overcome" the necessary result.
**RULE:** \`Remain Competitive (RC) -> Overcome Crisis (OC)\`

**"Alleviating this crisis REQUIRES the employment of successful teaching methods."**
The word REQUIRES is a necessary condition indicator. The "required" element (successful teaching methods) must be placed on the necessary (right) side of the arrow. The thing doing the requiring (alleviating the crisis) is the sufficient condition.
**RULE:** \`Overcome Crisis (OC) -> Successful Teaching Methods (STM)\`

**"NO method... can succeed that does NOT get students to spend... time studying..."**
The word NO introduces a global exclusion, often translated as \`A -> ~B\`. However, this sentence contains a double negative ("No method... that does not...").
**Translation Logic:** "No [method that doesn't study] can [succeed]." = \`If Not Study -> Not Succeed\`.
**Contrapositive (simpler):** \`If Succeed -> Study\`.
**RULE:** \`Successful Teaching Methods (STM) -> Students Spend Time Studying (STS)\``

`**(A) INCORRECT.** Diagram: \`STS -> OC\`. This is a MISTAKEN REVERSAL of the immediate link \`OC -> STS\`. While studying is necessary to overcome the crisis, it is not sufficient to guarantee it. There could be other requirements (funding, curriculum changes) needed as well.

**(B) CORRECT.** This choice tests the "Unless" rule. "Crisis NOT overcome UNLESS Study" translates to \`~Study -> ~Crisis Overcome\` (\`~STS -> ~OC\`). This is the exact contrapositive of the derived rule \`OC -> STS\`. Since \`OC -> STS\` is a valid link in our chain, its contrapositive must also be true.

**(C) INCORRECT.** This answer choice is OUT OF SCOPE. The politician claims mathematics is necessary for competitiveness, but never ranks it against other subjects. Logical rules do not imply value judgments or hierarchies unless explicitly stated.

**(D) INCORRECT.** Diagram: \`STS -> RC\`. This choice translates "ONLY IF we succeed... (RC)... will students spend time (STS)" into \`STS -> RC\`. This is a MISTAKEN REVERSAL of the entire chain. While RC guarantees STS, STS does not guarantee RC. Just because students study doesn't mean we automatically become competitive.

**(E) INCORRECT.** This relies on CAUSAL/CONTRIBUTORY reasoning. The answer suggests studying "would help" achieve the goal. Conditional logic (\`A -> B\`) is binary: A guarantees B. It does not deal in partial contributions or "helping." The stimulus says studying is a requirement, not just a helpful factor.`

`**The "UNLESS" Rule:** "Use... never feasible (\`~EF\`), UNLESS... substance above -148 (\`S > -148\`)."
**Strategy:** Identify the clause modified by unless ("there is a substance..."). Take the other clause ("Use... never feasible") and NEGATE IT to form the sufficient condition.
**Negation:** \`~(~EF)\` becomes \`EF\` (Economically Feasible).
**RULE:** \`EF -> S > -148\` (If it is feasible, then such a substance exists).

**The Conditional Rule:** "If there is such a substance, that substance MUST be an alloy of niobium and germanium."
**Justification:** "Such a substance" refers back to the necessary condition of the previous rule (superconducts > -148). "MUST" introduces the necessary condition.
**RULE:** \`S > -148 -> NG\` (Substance is Niobium-Germanium).

**The Fact:** "Unfortunately, such alloys superconduct at temperatures no higher than minus 160 degrees Celsius."
**Justification:** This is a factual statement about the properties of NG alloys. If the temperature is "no higher than -160," it is mathematically impossible for it to be "above -148."

`**THE CHAIN:** By linking Rule 1 and Rule 2, we get: \`EF -> S > -148 -> NG\`.

**THE CONFLICT:** The chain tells us that if economic feasibility (EF) occurs, we must have an NG alloy that superconducts above -148. However, our Fact tells us that NG alloys never superconduct above -148.

**LOGIC:** NG (necessary condition) physically cannot fulfill the requirement of S > -148 (the middle term).`
    },
    { type: 'callout', variant: 'default', title: 'STEP 3 - DERIVE CONCLUSION', text: 
`Since the necessary condition for economic feasibility (\`S > -148\`) is impossible to achieve (because the only candidate, NG, fails the test), the sufficient condition (EF) can never trigger.

**CONCLUSION:** \`~EF\` must be true. The use of superconductors will never be economically feasible.`
    },
    { type: 'callout', variant: 'default', title: 'STEP 4 - EVALUATE ANSWERS', text:
`**(A) CORRECT.** This perfectly matches our derived conclusion \`~EF\`. Because the necessary conditions for feasibility (a substance > -148) cannot be met by the only possible candidate (NG alloys), feasibility is impossible.

**(B) INCORRECT.** This contradicts Rule 2. Rule 2 states that if a substance > -148 exists, it MUST be an NG alloy (\`S > -148 -> NG\`). Answer (B) suggests that if NG alloys fail, "other substances" could work. The stimulus explicitly rules this out by making NG alloys the only candidate for high-temp superconductivity.

**(C) INCORRECT.** This is OUT OF SCOPE. The stimulus sets a hard floor for feasibility: the temperature must be ABOVE -148. If a substance superconducts BELOW -148, it fails the necessary condition established in the first sentence. It cannot lead to feasibility.

**(D) INCORRECT.** This is a MATH/LOGIC ERROR. The stimulus says NG alloys superconduct at temperatures "no higher than -160." This means -160 or lower (e.g., -170, -200). It does NOT mean they stop working below -160. They could work perfectly well at -273. We only know they don't work above -160.

**(E) INCORRECT.** This answer choice is TOO BROAD. The conclusion \`~EF\` applies to "the use of superconductors" defined in the stimulus (which implies general commercial use requiring high temps). Answer (E) claims no use of NG alloys will ever be feasible. Perhaps NG alloys are economically feasible for other specialized uses that don't require temps above -148. The argument is only about the specific feasibility conditioned on temperature.`

`**"ANY ship that sinks deep (SD) WHEN not fully flooded (NFF) will implode (I)."**

**Justification:** The word ANY is a sufficient condition indicator. It introduces a complex sufficient condition composed of two events joined by WHEN. This creates a compound "AND" relationship: the ship must satisfy both criteria simultaneously (sinking deep + not being fully flooded) to trigger the result. If only one happens, the result is not guaranteed.

**RULE:** \`(SD and NFF) -> Implode\``
    },
    { type: 'callout', variant: 'summary', title: 'STEP 2 - FORM THE CONTRAPOSITIVE', text:
`**The Negation:** To determine what must be true about a ship that did not implode, we negate the necessary condition (\`~Implode\`) and look back to the sufficient.

**The Flip (De Morgan's Law):** Since the original rule required a combination of two factors to cause the implosion, the absence of an implosion means the combination failed. A combination fails if at least one part is missing. Therefore, \`~(A and B)\` translates to \`~A or ~B\`.

**Contrapositive:** \`~Implode -> (~SD or ~NFF)\`
(Note: \`~NFF\` (Not Not Fully Flooded) simplifies to Fully Flooded (FF))

**FINAL CONTRAPOSITIVE:** \`~Implode -> (~SD or FF)\` (If it didn't implode, it either didn't sink deep OR it was fully flooded).`

`**Fact:** "The Rienzi did not implode." (\`~Implode\`)
**Implication:** Based on our contrapositive, at least one of the safety conditions must be present: either it didn't sink deep enough, or it was full of water (\`~SD or FF\`).

**Fact:** "The Rienzi sank deep." (\`SD\`)
**Logic:** This eliminates the first possibility. Since SD is true, ~SD is false. The "safety" of not sinking deep was not present.

**Deduction:** Logic dictates that in an "OR" statement, if one option is removed, the remaining option becomes a certainty. Since it wasn't \`~SD\`, it MUST be \`FF\`.
**Conclusion:** The Rienzi was Fully Flooded (FF).`
    },
    { type: 'callout', variant: 'default', title: 'STEP 4 - SYNTHESIZE WITH "NORMAL" CONDITIONS', text:
`**The "Normal" Rule:** The stimulus establishes a general rule for rapid sinkers: "Normally... water does not enter... quickly enough... to be fully flooded."

**The Conflict:** We derived in Step 3 that the Rienzi was fully flooded. Yet, we know it was a "rapidly sinking" ship. This creates a logical friction: The Rienzi achieved a state (Full Flooding) that normally doesn't happen with its speed of descent.

**Resolving the Anomaly:** The stimulus allows for exceptions, specifically noting "sabotage" as one way to achieve full flooding.

**Inference:** If we assume the "sabotage" exception didn't apply (as the correct answer choice asks us to do), there must be another explanation for how it defied the "normal" limitation. The only physical way to get that much water in that short of time is if it flooded "unusually fast."`
    },
    { type: 'callout', variant: 'default', title: 'STEP 5 - EVALUATE ANSWERS', text:
`**(A) INCORRECT.** This is OUT OF SCOPE. The stimulus discusses the physics of implosion and flooding rates. It never mentions the specific construction of the Rienzi regarding impact resistance.

**(B) INCORRECT.** This contradicts the timeline required by the physics of the stimulus. The rule implies that a ship must be fully flooded before it reaches the deep ocean pressure to avoid implosion. If it became flooded "only after" reaching the floor, it would have been "not fully flooded" during the descent and thus would have imploded.

**(C) CORRECT.** This conditional statement follows from our Step 4 synthesis. We know the Rienzi was fully flooded. The stimulus says this is not "normal" for a rapid sinker. Therefore, water entered faster than normal. If we rule out the stated exception (sabotage), the only remaining description for this event is that water entered "unusually fast."

**(D) INCORRECT.** This is a MISTAKEN NEGATION or speculation. The stimulus says rapid sinking normally prevents full flooding. Sinking more slowly might have actually allowed more time for water to enter, potentially ensuring full flooding and preventing implosion. We cannot prove it would have imploded.

**(E) INCORRECT.** This contradicts the universal rule given in the stimulus. The rule states "ANY ship... will implode." It does not provide exceptions for "strongly constructed" ships. Therefore, we cannot infer that construction saved it; we must infer that the condition for implosion (not being fully flooded) was absent.`

The most common error in compound logic is forgetting to flip "AND" to "OR" (or vice versa) when taking the contrapositive.

Wrong: \`~C -> (~A and ~B)\` (for an AND statement).
