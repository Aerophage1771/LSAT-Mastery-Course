Since "not unenforceable" simply means "enforceable," we can simplify the statement:\n    **Effective → Enforceable**\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply the Lesson Theme (The Contrapositive)**\n    Does **Effective → Enforceable** match our gap? No, it looks like a reversal. But remember, the contrapositive is 100% equivalent. Let\'s check it:\n\n    1.  **Reverse:** Enforceable → Effective\n    2.  **Negate:** **NOT Enforceable → NOT Effective**\n\n*   **The Reveal:**\n    By taking the contrapositive of Answer Choice (A), we strip away the disguise.
