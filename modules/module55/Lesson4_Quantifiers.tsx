    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**Objective:** The goal of this lesson is to help you accurately diagram statements involving quantifiers and make valid inferences from them. You will learn to spot the difference between rock-solid logical chains and the common fallacies that fall apart under scrutiny. Until now, we have mostly dealt with absolute statements. A phrase like "All dogs are mammals" creates a 100% certain relationship (Dog -> Mammal): if you have a dog, you definitely have a mammal. However, LSAT arguments rarely offer this level of certainty. More often, arguments rely on quantifiers\u2014words like "most" or "some"\u2014that express partial truths. Mastering the specific rules for these words is key to handling a large portion of Logical Reasoning questions and avoids the trap of treating a "likelihood" as a "guarantee."' },
