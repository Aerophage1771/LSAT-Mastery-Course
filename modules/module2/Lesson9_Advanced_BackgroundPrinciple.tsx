An author might begin an argument with a general rule, a definition, or a widely accepted truth. Because this statement is often abstract and seems important, it\'s easy to mistake it for the main conclusion. However, its true role is to serve as a **foundational premise** or a piece of **background context**. The author isn\'t trying to *prove* this principle; they are *using* it to prove a more specific point later in the argument. Your challenge is to distinguish the foundational rule from the specific claim the author builds upon it.' },
