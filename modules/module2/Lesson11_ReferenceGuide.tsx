      '**The Premise / Background Info (Most Common Trap):** The answer choice is a factually correct statement from the stimulus that serves as **evidence** or **context**, not the main point. It\'s tempting because it\'s true, but it\'s the proof, not the point.',
      '**The Intermediate Conclusion:** The answer choice is a sub-conclusion—a claim that is supported by evidence but is then used to support the main conclusion. It\'s a stepping-stone, not the final destination.',
      '**The Opposing Viewpoint:** The answer choice states the opinion the author is arguing *against*.',
      '**The Distortion:** The answer choice is very close to the conclusion but subtly alters a key detail. It might:\n    *   **Change the Scope:** e.g., "some" becomes "most"\n    *   **Change the Certainty:** e.g., "is likely to" becomes "is certain to"\n    *   **Shift the Subject:** e.g., focuses on a detail instead of the main idea.',
      '**The Logical Reversal:** The choice incorrectly swaps a sufficient and necessary condition from the conclusion (e.g., changes "This will enable..." to "One must...").'
