    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The questions in this section are designed to be challenging, often featuring complex argument structures and highly tempting incorrect answer choices. This example illustrates one of the most effective traps: the **intermediate conclusion**. On difficult questions, the test-makers will often place a strong intermediate conclusion at the very end of the stimulus, complete with an indicator like "Thus" or "Therefore." This makes it feel like the final point, trapping students who rely on indicator words without fully mapping the argument\'s structure. Your task is to see the entire logical chain and correctly distinguish the final destination from the last stepping-stone.' },
