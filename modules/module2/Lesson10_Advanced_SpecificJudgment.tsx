    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'This final advanced lesson tackles one of the most sophisticated traps on Main Conclusion questions. On difficult questions, the author will often make a specific judgment about a particular case based on a set of facts. A highly tempting incorrect answer choice will take this specific line of reasoning and generalize it into a broad, conditional "If... then..." rule. The trap lies in recognizing that the author\'s main point is often the **specific judgment itself**, not the general principle that might justify it. Your task is to be precise about the scope of the author\'s claim: Are they making a ruling on one specific situation, or are they trying to prove a universal law?' },
