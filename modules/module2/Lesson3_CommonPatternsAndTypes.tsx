Knowing the common patterns will help you spot the author's ultimate point more quickly and confidently. Think of this as a spotter's guide to the different \"species\" of conclusions." },
    { type: 'h4', text: '1. The Rebuttal (The Counter-Argument)' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**Description:** This is the most common type of argument (~45%). The author\'s primary goal is not to build a new case from scratch, but to **tear down an existing one**. The stimulus will introduce a claim, belief, or theory—often attributed to others—and the main conclusion will be the author\'s direct rejection of that position.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**How to Spot It:**' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**The Setup:** The argument will start by describing a position held by "some people," "many critics," "scientists," or a named individual.',
      '**The Pivot:** A strong contrast word like `But`, `However`, or `Yet` will signal the shift to the author\'s own conclusion.',
      '**The Rejection:** The conclusion itself will contain words that signal disagreement, such as *mistaken, ill founded, dubious,* or *unconvincing*.'

    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**Description:** This type of conclusion (~25%) moves beyond describing the world and makes a **judgment** about it or recommends a **course of action**. Instead of just stating facts, the author is telling you what is good/bad, right/wrong, or what someone *should* or *should not* do.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**How to Spot It:**' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Prescriptive Language:** Look for strong, opinionated words like `should` / `should not`, `must` / `needs to`, `it is advisable`.',

    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**Description:** These arguments (~20%) start with a known fact, observation, or puzzle and then seek to explain **why** it is the case. The main conclusion is the proposed cause or reason for the phenomenon. The author isn\'t trying to prove *that* something happened, but rather *why* it happened.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**How to Spot It:**' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Explanatory Language:** The conclusion will often be framed as a reason or cause, using phrases like `The reason for this is...`, `Prosperity is the cause of...`, or `This phenomenon can be explained by...`.',
      '**Structure:** Often, the stimulus starts with the thing to be explained, and the main conclusion is the explanation itself.'

    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**How to Spot It:**' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Predictive Language:** Look for phrases like `will` / `will not`, `is likely to` / `is unlikely to`, or `can be expected to`.',
      '**Declarative Statements:** The conclusion can be a simple statement of fact that is the logical result of the premises, often introduced by indicators like `Thus` or `So`.'
