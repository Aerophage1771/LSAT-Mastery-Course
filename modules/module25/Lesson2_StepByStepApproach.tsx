Does the author completely tear down the old theory (refute), or just point out its limitations while acknowledging some value (qualify)? This precision is often the deciding factor." },

The best answer will accurately reflect the weight and emphasis the author gives to each part of the argument. For example, if the author spends three paragraphs critiquing a theory and one sentence mentioning an alternative, an answer describing the passage as \"contrasting two theories\" is likely less accurate than one describing it as \"critiquing a prevailing view.\"" }
