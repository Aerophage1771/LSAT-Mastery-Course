    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** This is the most common pattern, relying on formal "if-then" logic. The argument links a series of conditional statements, and the conclusion is a deduction that follows from this chain.',
      '**Common Variations:**',
      '  • **Transitive Chain:** If A, then B. If B, then C. Therefore, if A, then C.',
      '  • **Contrapositive (Modus Tollens):** If A, then B. Not B. Therefore, Not A.',
      '  • **The Dilemma:** If A, then C. If Not A, then C. Therefore, C is inevitable.',
      '**How to Spot It:** Look for keywords like `if...then, any, all, every, only if, unless, no, none`. The argument is built on strict, deductive rules, and the conclusion often uses words like *must, will,* or *cannot*.'

    { type: 'h4', text: '2. The Quantifier Argument ("The Venn Diagram")' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** This pattern reasons about the relationships between groups using categorical logic, focusing on overlap and inclusion.',
      '**Common Variations:**',
      '  • **Overlap Deduction:** All A are B. Most B are C. Therefore, *some* A are C.',
      '  • **Exclusion Deduction:** No A are B. Some C are A. Therefore, *some* C are not B.',
      '**How to Spot It:** Look for keywords like `All, some, most, many, none, few`. The reasoning feels like a logic puzzle about categories.'

    { type: 'h4', text: '3. The Eliminative Argument ("Process of Elimination")' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** This straightforward pattern presents a limited set of options (usually two) and then eliminates one, leaving the other as the necessary conclusion (a Disjunctive Syllogism).',
      '**Structure:**\n    1. Either A or B is true.\n    2. A is not true.\n    3. Therefore, B must be true.',
      '**How to Spot It:** Look for keywords like `Either...or` or `the only options are...`.'

    { type: 'h4', text: '4. The Principle Application ("The Judge")' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** The argument establishes a general principle—often a moral rule, a practical standard, or a cost-benefit analysis—and then applies it to a specific case to render a judgment.',
      '**Common Variations:**',
      '  • **Cost-Benefit:** An action\'s long-term costs outweigh its short-term benefits, so it is *unwise*.',
      '  • **Fairness/Justice:** An authority\'s own wrongdoing delegitimizes their ability to punish another, so the punishment is *unjustified*.',
      '**How to Spot It:** Look for prescriptive or evaluative keywords like `should, ought, unwise, justified, reckless, better`. The argument moves from a general "rule" to a specific "verdict."'

    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** The argument\'s primary focus is to explain *why* something is the case. It often begins with an observed phenomenon (a correlation) and then argues for or against a particular causal explanation.',
      '**Common Variations:**',
      '  • **Alternative Cause (Third Factor):** Argues that X does not cause Y because a third factor, Z, causes both X and Y.',
      '  • **Reversed Causality:** Argues that X does not cause Y because, in fact, Y causes X.',
      '**How to Spot It:** Look for keywords like `causes, leads to, results from, is explained by, the reason for`.'

    { type: 'h4', text: '6. The Inductive Prediction ("The Forecaster")' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** This pattern uses past evidence to make a prediction about a future event. It is an inductive argument, meaning the conclusion is probable, not certain.',
      '**Structure:**\n    1. A pattern has been observed in the past (e.g., "Most X\'s have been Y," or "This has never happened before").\n    2. Therefore, this pattern will likely continue for the next instance.',
      '**How to Spot It:** Look for probabilistic keywords like `probably, likely, unlikely, expect`. The premises refer to past events ("to date," "in the last ten years") and the conclusion projects this pattern onto a future event ("the next time").'
