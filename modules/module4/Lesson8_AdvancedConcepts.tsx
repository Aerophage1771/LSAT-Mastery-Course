      '**The "Almost Perfect" Parallel:** This is the most dangerous trap. It matches the conclusion type, number of premises, and overall flow, but changes one tiny logical operator, swapping an "and" for an "or," or a "some" for a "most."',
      '**The "Valid for Invalid" Swap:** If the stimulus contains a specific logical flaw (e.g., a Mistaken Reversal), a sophisticated trap answer will be a *valid* argument that uses very similar language, preying on students who aren\'t actively looking for the flaw.',
      '**The "Conclusion Subject" Swap:** The premises will match perfectly, but the conclusion will be about a different subject (e.g., concluding something about Group C when the stimulus concluded something about Group A).'
