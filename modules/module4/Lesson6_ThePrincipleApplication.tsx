The stimulus presents a specific situation from which you must first **extract a general principle**—often a moral, legal, or practical rule. Your task is then to find the one answer choice that perfectly **applies that same principle** to a new, different situation.' },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'While some test preppers categorize these questions under a general "Principle" family, their core task is so similar to Parallel Reasoning that they are best mastered here. Just as in other Parallel questions, you are creating an abstract blueprint from the stimulus—in this case, the principle—and then searching for an answer choice with an identical structure. The mental process of abstracting a rule and finding its parallel is the key skill.' },

      '(A) After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price’s guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.',
      '(B) Shakila’s secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.',
      '(C) After Takashi told Sarah’s parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah’s parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.',
      '(D) After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.',
      '(E) Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff’s financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.'

    ]},

      { title: '(A)', text: '**Analysis:** This illustrates the principle that "two wrongs don\'t make a right."

This is a different principle.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** (Principle Mismatch)' },
      { title: '(B)', text: '**Analysis:** This illustrates the principle of hypocrisy (the "you too" or *tu quoque* argument). Shakila\'s wrongdoing is a separate, past act. It was not part of how she discovered her secretary\'s current misdeed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** (Principle Mismatch)' },
      { title: '(C)', text: '**Analysis:** This choice has two flaws. First, the punishing authority (the parents) is a different entity from the person who also did something wrong (Takashi). Our principle requires the authority itself to be the one who committed the procedural wrong. Second, Takashi\'s wrongdoing (violating curfew) was unrelated to his act of discovering Sarah\'s misdeed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** (Structural Mismatch)' },
      { title: '(D)', text: '**Analysis:** Let\'s check this against our blueprint. The **authority** (officer) committed a **wrongdoing** (trespassing) **in the process of discovering** Kuttner\'s misdeed. Therefore, the officer **cannot justifiably punish** Kuttner. This is a perfect illustration of the principle.\n**Verdict: Correct.**' },
      { title: '(E)', text: '**Analysis:** The reason the board cannot punish Ramirez is based on the principle of consistency or precedent. The argument is that it\'s unfair to punish one person for something others were pardoned for. This is a different principle from the one in the stimulus, which is about procedural misconduct by the authority.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** (Principle Mismatch)' }
