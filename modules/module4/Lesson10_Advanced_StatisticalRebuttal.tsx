    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'This lesson focuses on a common form of reasoning: using a **statistical base rate** to argue against a conclusion drawn from a small number of seemingly significant cases. The core idea is that a few coincidences are not enough to prove a general rule, especially when they are vastly outnumbered by cases that show no such connection. The argument works by comparing a small, interesting sample to a much larger, less interesting one.' },
