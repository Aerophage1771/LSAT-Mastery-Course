      '**The Invalid Mirror (Reversal/Negation):** The answer choice looks identical but commits a formal logic flaw (like a Mistaken Reversal) while the stimulus is valid, or vice versa.\n    *   **Avoidance:** Always confirm the *direction* of the arrows in your diagram. Don\'t just match keywords.',
      '**The Quantifier Mismatch:** The structure is perfect, but the certainty is wrong. The stimulus uses "most" and the trap uses "some." The stimulus concludes "will" and the trap concludes "might."\n    *   **Avoidance:** Make certainty and quantifiers a non-negotiable part of your blueprint. Use them as your first filter.',
      '**The Structure Swap:** The answer choice uses all the right logical pieces but rearranges them, often using a premise as the conclusion or vice versa.\n    *   **Avoidance:** Confirm the role of each statement. Use the "Therefore Test" to be certain what the main point is.',
      '**The Scope Shift:** The argument\'s subject changes subtly between premises and conclusion (e.g., from "individual trees" to "tree species," or from "the next song" to "any song").\n    *   **Avoidance:** Ensure the conclusion is about the exact same entity or group as the premises.'
