    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Advanced Parallel Reasoning questions often move beyond simple `A → B → C` chains. They test your ability to navigate more complex logical structures that combine different operators, most commonly **"AND"** (a conjunction) and **"OR"** (a disjunction). These arguments require a higher level of precision in your diagramming and blueprinting. The core task remains the same, but the blueprint itself becomes more detailed and sophisticated.' },

But anyone who has worked at Teltech for more than six months who does not have sales experience has a university diploma. Thus, one cannot get an executive position at Teltech unless one has worked there for six months.',
      '(B) To be elected class president, one must be well liked and well known. Anyone who is well liked or well known has something better to do than run for class president. Therefore, no one who has something better to do will be elected class president.',
      '(C) To grow good azaleas, one needs soil that is both rich in humus and low in acidity. Anyone who has soil that is rich in humus or low in acidity can grow blueberries. So, anyone who cannot grow blueberries cannot grow good azaleas.',
      '(D) To drive to Weller, one must take the highway or take Old Mill Road. Anyone who drives to Weller on the highway will miss the beautiful scenery. Thus, one cannot see the beautiful scenery without taking Old Mill Road to Weller.',
      '(E) To get a discount on ice cream, one must buy frozen raspberries and ice cream together. Anyone who buys ice cream or raspberries will get a coupon for a later purchase. So, anyone who does not get the discount on ice cream will not get a coupon for a later purchase.'
