      '(D) Chefs who become celebrities either open their own restaurants or write books about their craft, but not both... Therefore, Endicott does not write books about his craft.',
      '(E) Every catering service in Woodside Township will accept both residential and business catering assignments... Hence, Peggy’s Fine Foods is not in Woodside Township.'
