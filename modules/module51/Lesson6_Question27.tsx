const passageText = `By the time Bentham turned his interest to the subject, late in the eighteenth century, most components of modern evidence law had been assembled. Among common-law doctrines regarding evidence there were, however, principles that today are regarded as bizarre; thus, a well-established (but now abandoned) rule forbade the parties to a case from testifying. Well into the nineteenth century, even defendants in criminal cases were denied the right to testify to facts that would prove their innocence.
Although extreme in its irrationality, this proscription was in other respects quite typical of the law of evidence. Much of that law consisted of rules excluding relevant evidence, usually on some rational grounds. Hearsay evidence was generally excluded because absent persons could not be cross-examined. Yet such evidence was mechanically excluded even where out-of-court statements were both relevant and reliable, but the absent persons could not appear in court (for example, because they were dead).
The morass of evidentiary technicalities often made it unlikely that the truth would emerge in a judicial contest, no matter how expensive and protracted. Reform was frustrated both by the vested interests of lawyers and by the profession’s reverence for tradition and precedent. Bentham’s prescription was revolutionary: virtually all evidence tending to prove or disprove the issue in dispute should be admissible. Narrow exceptions were envisioned: instances in which the trouble or expense of presenting or considering proof outweighed its value, confessions to a Catholic priest, and a few other instances.
One difficulty with Bentham’s nonexclusion principle is that some kinds of evidence are inherently unreliable or misleading. Such was the argument underlying the exclusions of interested-party testimony and hearsay evidence. Bentham argued that the character of evidence should be weighed by the jury: the alternative was to prefer ignorance to knowledge. Yet some evidence, although relevant, is actually more likely to produce a false jury verdict than a true one. To use a modern example, evidence of a defendant’s past bank robberies is excluded, since the prejudicial character of the evidence substantially outweighs its value in helping the jury decide correctly. Further, in granting exclusions such as sacramental confessions, Bentham conceded that competing social interests or values might override the desire for relevant evidence. But then, why not protect conversations between social workers and their clients, or parents and children?
Despite concerns such as these, the approach underlying modern evidence law began to prevail soon after Bentham’s death: relevant evidence should be admitted unless there are clear grounds of policy for excluding it. This clear-grounds proviso allows more exclusions than Bentham would have liked, but the main thrust of the current outlook is Bentham’s own nonexclusion principle, demoted from a rule to a presumption.`;

      { title: "(A)", text: "This choice best describes the passage's overall purpose. The passage presents Bentham's nonexclusion principle as a reform with advantages over the old system, but it also dedicates a full paragraph to discussing its 'difficulty' and limitations, such as how to handle misleading evidence or competing social values. Additional check: this option misses the stem by adding assumptions or emphasis that the passage does not support." },
      { title: "(B)", text: "This is too narrow. While the first two paragraphs describe the deficiencies of an old legal system, this answer ignores the main focus of the passage, which is Bentham's proposed reform, its problems, and its eventual adoption. Additional check: trap type is too narrow, since it leaves out a required part of the passage's claim." },
      { title: "(C)", text: "The passage describes current evidence law but does not try to justify its inadequacies. Instead, it explains how modern law is a modified version of Bentham's principle, suggesting it is an improvement over the past, not defending its remaining flaws. Additional check: this option misses the stem by adding assumptions or emphasis that the passage does not support." },
      { title: "(D)", text: "This choice is too specific.

Additional check: this option misses the stem by adding assumptions or emphasis that the passage does not support." },
      { title: "(E)", text: "This is inaccurate because the passage states that Bentham's proposal was not dismissed. The final paragraph clearly says that the 'main thrust of the current outlook is Bentham’s own nonexclusion principle,' meaning it was largely accepted. Additional check: this option misses the stem by adding assumptions or emphasis that the passage does not support." }
