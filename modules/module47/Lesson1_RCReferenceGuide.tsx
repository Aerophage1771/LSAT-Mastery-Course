The key to consistent improvement is moving away from a \"vibes-based\" approach and mastering the specific **Core Task** required by each question." },

        { title: 'The Approach', text: '1.  **Paragraph Synthesis:** After reading, summarize the main point or function of *each paragraph* in your own words.\n2.  **Build the Blueprint:** Chain these summaries together sequentially to form a logical blueprint of the passage\'s argument flow.\n3.  **Predict & Match:** Based on this blueprint, formulate a single sentence that captures the entire narrative arc. Find the answer choice that matches this prediction.\n4.  **Backup Plan (Elimination):** If no clear match emerges, switch to elimination. First, remove any choice containing factually inaccurate information. Then, among the remaining choices, select the one that is the most comprehensive and covers all parts of your blueprint.' },

What do they want you to believe?\n2.  **Analyze the Method:** Next, ask *how* the author supports that thesis. What is their primary rhetorical move throughout the passage?\n3.  **Select the Precise Verb:** Choose an abstract verb that accurately describes this method (e.g., *defending*, *explaining*, *proposing*, *critiquing*).\n4.  **Confirm the Scope:** The correct answer will combine this precise verb with an accurate description of the passage\'s overall topic.' },

The correct answer will preserve the original sentence\'s logic.' },
