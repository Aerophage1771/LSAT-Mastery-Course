One of them may weaken or strengthen a similar argument, but not the exact one the question is targeting. For example, if the conclusion is about \"mammals in the Cretaceous period,\" an answer choice about \"all animals throughout history\" is likely a scope mismatch. The correct answer must precisely match the scope of the argument." }
