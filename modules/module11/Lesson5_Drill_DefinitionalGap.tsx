    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This drill focuses on a 'connector' assumption. The author first defines a standard or function for something. Then, they describe how that thing has changed or can be categorized differently. The argument concludes that because of this new category, the thing can no longer meet its original standard. The necessary assumption is the unstated belief that the new category and the original standard are incompatible." },

But in a consumer society, news becomes a product to be manufactured and dispensed to the consumer. An enormous industry for the production and consumption of news has evolved, and we ingest news with an insatiable appetite. Under such circumstances, news is primarily entertaining and cannot, therefore, serve its intended function." },
