      { title: "(B) Any nation in which the prevailing attitude of consumers is not skepticism will experience economic growth.", text: "This is too vague. \"Not skepticism\" could mean 100% confidence, which violates the principle's requirement for a balance.

The choice correctly concludes the nation \"will not experience economic growth.\"", badge: "Correct", badgeColor: "green" },

    { type: 'callout', title: "Key Takeaway", variant: "summary", text: "This question highlights the critical difference between sufficient and necessary conditions. The phrase \"only when\" (along with \"only if\" and \"requires\") introduces a necessary condition. The most reliable way to apply such a rule is often by using its contrapositive. When you encounter a principle with a necessary condition, consider what happens when that requirement is *not* met. The absence of a necessary condition definitively proves that the outcome cannot occur." }
