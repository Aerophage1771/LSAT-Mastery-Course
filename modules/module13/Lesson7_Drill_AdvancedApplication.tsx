The principle will contain extreme or specific modifiers like \"overwhelming,\" \"disastrous,\" \"solely,\" or \"never.\" These words are not used casually; they set a very high bar that must be cleared. Your task is to be hyper-literal in your reading and differentiate between a \"harm\" and a \"disaster,\" or between \"some evidence\" and \"overwhelming evidence.\"" },

Words like \"overwhelming,\" \"disastrous,\" \"always,\" and \"solely\" are the load-bearing walls of the argument's logic. The LSAT creates difficult trap answers by presenting situations that meet one extreme condition but not the other. In choice (E), the consequence was disastrous, but the evidence was weak. In choice (A), the evidence was present, but the consequence was not disastrous. Only the correct answer will navigate these thresholds perfectly." }
