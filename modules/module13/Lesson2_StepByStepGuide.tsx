      '**Find the ""If/Then"" Logic:** Look for words that define the rule, like *if*, *only if*, or *unless*. Try to turn the rule into a simple ""If this happens, then that is the result"" statement.',
      '**Find the Cause and the Result:** Identify exactly what needs to happen to make the rule apply (the **Cause**), and exactly what the result must be once it does (the **Result**).',
      '**Watch the Small Words:** Pay close attention to words like *only*, *all*, or *some*. Does the rule care about what someone *intended* to do, or just what actually *happened*? These small details are usually where the test tries to trick you.'

      '**Task A: Find the Best Example.** You are given a rule and must find an answer choice that applies it correctly to a new scenario.\n    *   *Example:* The rule says ""A driver should be ticketed only if they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph."" The right answer could be: ""Officer Smith did not ticket Jane, because she was only going 5 mph over the limit.""',
      '**Task B: Find the Missing Piece.** You are given a rule and a specific conclusion, but there is a gap in the facts. You must find the fact that makes the conclusion follow the rule.\n    *   *Example:* The rule says ""A driver should be ticketed only if they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph."" The conclusion is ""Therefore, Mark should not be ticketed."" The missing fact (the answer) could be: ""Mark was driving exactly at the speed limit.""'

    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**For Task A (Find Example):** Decide what the scenario should prove. Look for the scenario where the requirements of the rule are met, leading to the necessary result. Predicting this match helps you spot the correct application quickly.',
      '**For Task B (Find Fact):** Compare the conclusion to the facts you already have. Look for the ""gap""—the specific requirement mentioned in the rule that isn\'t yet proven by the facts. Your goal is to find the one piece of information that bridges that gap.'

    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Check the Cause:** Does the scenario in the answer choice actually meet the conditions of the rule? Ensure every requirement (the ""If"" part) is fully satisfied by the facts.',
      '**Check the Result:** Does the conclusion in the answer choice match the rule\'s outcome exactly?',
      '**For Task B:** Verify that the answer choice is the **only** thing needed to connect the facts you have to the conclusion you were given.'

    { type: 'h3', text: 'Step 5: Eliminate the Wrong Answers' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Be ready to spot the specific ways the test makers try to trick you. Wrong answers usually fall into one of these traps:' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Trap: The ""Almost"" Match.** The answer uses the right words but changes a small detail. For example, the rule requires ""intent to harm,"" but the answer choice only describes ""accidental harm.""',
      '**Trap: The Backward Logic.** The answer tries to run the rule in reverse (**Mistaken Reversal**). Just because the result happened doesn\'t mean the cause happened.',
      '**Trap: The Missing Factor.** The answer leaves out a key requirement. If the rule says ""If A and B, then C,"" a wrong answer might say ""A happened, so C happened,"" completely ignoring B.'
