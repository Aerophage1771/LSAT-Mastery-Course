    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Easy Agree/Disagree questions involve direct, explicit contradictions. The hardest questions, however, are rarely so straightforward. They conceal the point of contention or consensus within layers of abstraction, unstated assumptions, or competing frameworks. This guide focuses on the three most challenging patterns you will encounter." },

    { type: 'h4', text: "1. The Clash of Criteria" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This pattern occurs when speakers agree on the facts of a situation but use different standards to evaluate those facts, leading to opposite conclusions. Their disagreement is not about *what is*, but about *what matters*." },
    { type: 'list', items: [
        "**The Strategic Insight:** The conflict is not about the evidence itself, but about which standard of judgment is the correct one to apply. One speaker's entire argument will rest on the primacy of their chosen criterion (e.g., artistic merit, safety, efficiency), while the second speaker will explicitly prioritize a different one (e.g., public opinion, personal liberty, cost).",
        "**How to Apply This Strategy:**\n1.  Isolate the standard of judgment each speaker uses. Ask yourself, \"What is the ultimate reason for their conclusion?\"\n2.  Frame the conflict as a choice between these two standards.\n3.  Find the answer choice that questions the *relevance* or *centrality* of one speaker's standard. The correct answer will be a statement one speaker believes is the most important consideration and the other believes is irrelevant or secondary.",
        "**Strategic Tip:** When speakers agree on the facts but reach different conclusions, the point of contention is almost always the rule or standard they are using to make their judgment."

    { type: 'h4', text: "2. The Definitional Dispute" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Here, the entire argument hinges on the definition of a key term. The speakers propose conflicting rules, often involving necessary or sufficient conditions, and the point at issue is a direct test of their competing definitions." },
    { type: 'list', items: [
        "**The Strategic Insight:** The most efficient way to solve this is to formalize the logic. One speaker will propose a rule, such as \"To be considered X, something must have characteristic A.\" The other speaker will reject this rule, often by proposing a different one, such as \"Having characteristic B is enough to be considered X.\" The dispute is whether something can be X if it fails the first speaker's test but passes the second's.",
        "**How to Apply This Strategy:**\n1.  Translate each speaker's definition into a conditional rule (e.g., \"If X, then Y\").\n2.  Look for an answer choice, often a complex conditional statement itself, that presents a scenario where the two rules would yield opposite results.\n3.  Apply the Truth Test: one speaker's rule will force them to deny the statement, while the other speaker's rule will force them to affirm it.",
        "**Strategic Tip:** When a disagreement centers on the meaning of a term, formalizing the logic is your most powerful tool. The correct answer will be the one that perfectly isolates the logical conflict between their two rules."

    { type: 'h4', text: "3. Consensus in Conflict (The Hardest \"Agree\" Questions)" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "These questions are challenging because the speakers' final conclusions are often diametrically opposed. The point of agreement is not an obvious fact but a deeper, structural element of their arguments—a shared assumption that both must hold for their arguments to be coherent." },
    { type: 'list', items: [
        "**The Strategic Insight:** The shared belief is what *enables* their disagreement. Without it, their arguments wouldn't be on the same topic. This consensus typically takes one of two forms:\n*   **The Shared Diagnosis:** They agree on the existence of a problem or symptom but disagree on its specific cause or meaning.\n*   **The Shared Causal Link:** They agree that a factor *will cause an effect* but disagree on whether the effect will be positive or negative.",
        "**How to Apply This Strategy:**\n1.  Look past the conflicting conclusions to the shared starting point of their arguments.\n2.  Find an answer choice that states this shared premise in a more general or neutral way.\n3.  The correct answer will be a statement that both speakers must accept as true for their specific (and conflicting) claims to make sense.",
        "**Strategic Tip:** For difficult \"Agree\" questions, look for the unstated foundation of the argument. Pay close attention to neutral language like \"affects,\" \"influences,\" or \"is a factor in,\" as these words can often capture a shared belief in a causal link without specifying the conflicting outcomes."
