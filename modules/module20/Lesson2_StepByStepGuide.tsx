You cannot assume disagreement (or agreement) from silence; both speakers must explicitly address the topic.',
      '**Trap: The Point of Agreement Trap (for Disagreement questions).** The statement is something both speakers actually agree on (often a shared premise or background fact). It is tempting because it is factually true within the text, but it is incorrect because the prompt asks for a conflict.',
      '**Trap: The Out of Scope Trap.** The choice relies on information, comparisons, or details that go beyond what either speaker discussed. If the text doesn\'t support it, the answer is incorrect.',
      '**Trap: The Mischaracterization Trap.** The choice distorts a speaker\'s actual argument. It often uses extreme language (like *all, always, never,* or *only*) to make a moderate claim sound absolute, or it attributes a view to a speaker that they never actually held.'
