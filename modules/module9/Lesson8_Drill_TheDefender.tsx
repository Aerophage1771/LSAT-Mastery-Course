The psychologist assumes that overconfidence comes first and leads to entrepreneurship. But what if the reverse is true? Perhaps the act of being an entrepreneur—surviving against the odds, making risky decisions—*makes* a person more overconfident over time. The study only looks at people who are *already* in these roles; it doesn\'t establish a timeline.' },

      '**Rule Out Reverse Causality:** The most direct way to strengthen this is to show that the trait (overconfidence) exists independently of the role (entrepreneur). You want to show that overconfidence leads to the *attempt* to start a business, not that succeeding as an entrepreneur leads to overconfidence.',

When an argument makes a causal claim based on a correlation between a group and a trait, the correct answer often provides a "mini-study" or a new fact that isolates the trait from the group.
