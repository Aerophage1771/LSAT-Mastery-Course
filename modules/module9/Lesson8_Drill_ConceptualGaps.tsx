The author will use a premise about one idea (like size or wealth) to draw a conclusion about another, seemingly unrelated idea (like status). Your job is to find the answer choice that provides the missing link, often an unstated assumption, that connects these two concepts and makes the conclusion logical.' },

From this, it concludes that the feature was a "status symbol" intended to display that wealth.' },

But what if there\'s a practical, economic reason? What if narrow floorboards were simply *cheaper* or more efficient to produce? If that were true, they would be a sign of thrift, not a symbol of status. The argument\'s entire logic rests on the unstated assumption that narrow boards were not a budget-friendly choice.' },

      '**Rule Out the "Cheaper" Alternative:** The most direct way to strengthen the "status symbol" theory is to show that the narrow boards were not a cost-saving measure. If they were at least as expensive as, or even more expensive than, wide boards, then the choice to use them could not have been about saving money.',
      '**Provide a Mechanism for "Status":** You could also strengthen the argument by showing that narrow boards required more labor or more skill to install, which would also make them a display of wealth.'
