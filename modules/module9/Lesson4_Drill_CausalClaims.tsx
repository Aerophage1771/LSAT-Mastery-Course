These encompass a lot of different subtypes depending on why the author is inclined to think that causation exists. Sometimes it is because one event happened after another, because two events are similar in some way, or because the individual being discussed has some kind of incentive or connection to the effect.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'However, by far the most common format we see on the LSAT is the claim that two things have a causal relationship based on a correlation observed between them. We want to be able to recognize what types of strengtheners fit the situation where the author makes a significant jump from noting that two things are in the same place to concluding that one causes the other.' },

The author is making a causal claim.

    { type: 'h4', text: 'Step 2: Analysis' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**What Method of Reasoning is the argument using?**\nThe argument identifies a statistical correlation between working in Department F and having a stress-related syndrome. It then concludes that the specific environment of Department F is the cause of increased stress levels. It relies on the pre-existing link between the syndrome and stress to justify the claim that the work itself is to blame.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "**What's the Problem?**\nThe author assumes that the work environment is the only way to explain the high rate of the syndrome. They overlook the possibility that the workers who end up in Department F might already be more stressed than other workers before they even start their jobs. This is a jump from correlation to causation." },
    { type: 'h4', text: 'Step 3: How Can We Strengthen?' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Since the core problem is the jump from correlation to causation, you can support the argument in a few specific ways. Ruling out alternative causes is often the most direct method, as it eliminates other plausible explanations and leaves the author\'s preferred cause as the most likely candidate.' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Rule Out Alternative Causes:** The argument is vulnerable to the idea that something else is causing the syndrome. For example, maybe Department F is the only one where workers are exposed to a certain chemical. An effective strengthener would eliminate such possibilities.',
      '**Show That "No Cause" Means "No Effect":** If removing the alleged cause also removes the effect, the connection becomes much stronger. You can do this by adding a control group or establishing a timeline. For instance, if people were healthy before they entered the high-stress environment and only got sick after, it strongly suggests the environment was the cause.',
      '**Provide a Mechanism:** The argument would be stronger if you had a clear reason to believe the work in Department F *should* be stressful. For example, a fact showing that the working conditions in Department F are significantly more difficult than in other departments would make the stress connection much more reasonable.'

      { title: '(A) Department F has more employees than any other department in the company.', text: '[The Proportionality Trap]\nThe stimulus is based on a percentage of workers, not the total number. If Department F has one thousand workers and ten percent are sick, that is one hundred people. If Department G has ten workers and one percent is sick, that is a very small number of people. The raw size of the department does not explain why the rate of sickness is higher in one group than the other.', badge: 'Incorrect', badgeColor: 'red' },
      { title: '(B) Some experts believe that the syndrome can be caused by various factors, only one of which is high stress.', text: '[The Weakener]\nThis choice actually hurts the argument.

      { title: '(C) Many workers who transfer into Department F from elsewhere in the company soon begin to develop the syndrome.', text: '[The Correct Choice]\nThis provides a before and after timeline. It shows that people who were presumably healthy in other departments only became afflicted after they started working in Department F. This rules out the idea that naturally stressed people simply choose to apply for jobs in Department F.', badge: 'Correct', badgeColor: 'green' },
      { title: '(D) It is relatively common for workers in the transportation industry to suffer from the syndrome.', text: '[The Irrelevant Context]\nThis might explain why the company has the syndrome at all, but it does not explain the internal difference between Department F and the other departments. It provides no help for the specific conclusion that the work in Department F is more stressful than the work elsewhere.', badge: 'Incorrect', badgeColor: 'red' },
      { title: '(E) Job-related stress has been the most frequently cited cause for dissatisfaction among workers at the company.', text: '[The Scope Mismatch]\nDissatisfaction is not the same thing as the specific medical syndrome mentioned in the stimulus.

    { type: 'h3', text: 'Key Takeaway' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'When you see an argument that makes a causal claim based on a correlation, you should immediately look for ways to show how these two things are connected and why they would be configured the way the author claims. By providing a mechanism or a clear timeline, you can make the relationship more likely by strengthening the degree of correlation. This can be done by showing that the effect does not appear without the cause being present, which makes that cause a more likely specific factor. You can also eliminate alternative possibilities that seem like eligible candidates, making it more likely that the remaining possibility is the correct one. All of these methods make it more likely that there is not another justification for these two things occurring together without being causatively related.' }
