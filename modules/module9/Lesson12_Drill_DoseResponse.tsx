When an author argues that an increase in one thing causes an increase in another, the most effective way to strengthen this is to show that the two things increase *together*, step-by-step. This demonstrates a consistent, dynamic correlation, which is much stronger evidence for causation than a single snapshot in time.' },

This is a weak form of correlation. What if the students who were already good at composition also happened to be the ones who got good at automatic handwriting? Maybe a third factor, like general intelligence or focus, caused both outcomes. The argument needs to show a more dynamic link between the *process* of improving one skill and the *process* of improving the other.' },

This means that small improvements in handwriting were linked to small improvements in composition, medium to medium, and large to large. This step-by-step correlation is much harder to dismiss as a coincidence.',
