The correct answer will often provide a qualifying fact that validates the author\'s use of the statistic and rules out a way the data could be misleading.' },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**What\'s the Problem?**\nThe statistic is cherry-picked and potentially misleading. A station could achieve a near-perfect accuracy rate on rain forecasts by simply never forecasting rain unless they are 100% certain. For example, if it rains 50 times a year, and a station only predicts rain on 2 of those days but gets them right, their accuracy rate *when they predict rain* is 100%. However, they have failed to warn their viewers about the other 48 rainy days, making them not very "useful or reliable." The argument ignores the other side of the coin: how often did it rain when they *failed* to predict it?' },

      '**Validate the Statistic\'s Relevance:** The most direct way to strengthen the argument is to show that the meteorologist\'s station is not "gaming the system." You need evidence that they are making a good-faith effort to predict rain, not just avoiding predictions to keep their accuracy high.',
      '**Rule Out "Playing It Safe":** An effective strengthener would show that the station makes rain forecasts frequently, which means their high accuracy is not just the result of making very few, very safe predictions.'

If the meteorologist\'s station predicts rain *more often* than their competitor, it means they are not "playing it safe." Their high accuracy is achieved while making more frequent, and thus riskier, predictions.

    { type: 'callout', title: 'Key Takeaway', variant: 'summary', text: 'When an argument relies on a specific, narrow statistic to prove a broad conclusion, be skeptical. The most common flaw is that the statistic might be "cherry-picked" to hide a larger weakness. To strengthen such an argument, you must find an answer that validates the statistic by showing it is not being used in a misleading way. Often, this involves providing a qualifier that demonstrates the statistic was generated under conditions that make it a fair and representative measure of overall performance.' }
