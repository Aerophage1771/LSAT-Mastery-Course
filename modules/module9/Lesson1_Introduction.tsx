In a Strengthen question, you are given a fact that specifically bridges that gap. Your task is to diagnose the argument’s central weakness and find the answer choice that best shores up that weak point. This is one of the most common and essential tasks in the section.' },

The correct answer acts as an additional premise that makes the author’s leap in logic more secure.

Your only job is to determine which of those five """"facts"""" provides the most logical help to the author’s specific conclusion.' }
