      '**Apples to Oranges:** The author says something will happen in one case because it happened in a ""similar"" one.\n    *   **Logical Gap:** Are the two cases actually similar where it counts? Is there a significant difference that makes the comparison fail?',
      '**The Flawed Plan:** The argument claims a plan will work or is a good idea without addressing potential obstacles.\n    *   **Logical Gap:** Does the plan have hidden downsides? Does the author just assume it works without explaining the mechanism?'
