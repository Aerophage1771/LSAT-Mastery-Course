    { type: 'h3', text: 'Advanced: Hallmarks of Difficult Strengthen Questions' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'As you progress to harder Strengthen questions, the nature of the support changes. The correct answer is often less about providing a "louder" version of the existing evidence and more about performing a subtle but critical logical function. Here are the key characteristics that differentiate the most challenging Strengthen questions.' },
    { type: 'h4', text: '1. The Defender: Ruling Out Alternative Explanations' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "In easier questions, the strengthener often directly proves the conclusion is more likely. In hard questions, the correct answer often plays \"defense.\" It does not provide new positive evidence for the author's claim; instead, it eliminates a key alternative explanation that would have weakened the argument. This is especially common in causal arguments where the author has jumped from a correlation to a specific cause. The correct answer makes the author's explanation more likely by making other explanations less likely." },
    { type: 'h4', text: '2. The Bridge: Connecting Disparate Concepts' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Hard questions often feature a logical gap between the concepts in the premise and the concepts in the conclusion. The correct answer acts as a "bridge," explicitly connecting these two ideas in a way the author assumed but did not state. Test-takers often miss these because the answer choice can look like a new, unrelated premise. For example, if the premise is about cost and the conclusion is about social status, the strengthener will provide a rule or a fact that links cost to social status.' },
    { type: 'h4', text: '3. The Analogy: Supporting Through a Parallel Case' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Instead of discussing the specific subject of the argument, the correct answer may discuss a *different* subject that is analogous or structurally similar. This requires you to recognize the underlying logical pattern and see how a fact about a parallel situation can validate the reasoning in the original argument. The support is indirect and relies on the strength of the analogy." },
    { type: 'h4', text: "4. The Net Effect: Defending a Plan's Viability" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "In arguments proposing a plan or a course of action, the hardest questions often focus on the practical feasibility or the \"net benefit\" of the plan. Instead of just supporting the stated positive outcome, the correct answer will often rule out a potential negative side effect that could have outweighed the benefits. This strengthens the overall recommendation by making it seem more practical, less risky, and more likely to succeed in the real world." },
    { type: 'h4', text: '5. The Qualifier: Validating the Data or Comparison' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'In arguments that deal with statistics, surveys, or comparisons, the hardest strengtheners often add a crucial piece of qualifying information that the author overlooked. For example, if an author compares two groups based on a single metric, the strengthener might provide a new fact that validates the fairness or relevance of that comparison. This requires a close reading of what the numbers in the argument actually represent versus what the author concludes they represent.' },
    { type: 'h4', text: '6. The "EXCEPT" Inversion: Identifying the Non-Supporter' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The "Strengthen EXCEPT" format adds a layer of complexity by inverting your task. Instead of finding the one answer that helps, you must find four valid strengtheners and eliminate them to find the one that does not. The difficulty here lies in the cognitive load of evaluating five separate impacts. The correct answer—the one that does *not* strengthen—is typically either completely irrelevant to the logical core of the argument or, in some cases, it may even slightly weaken the conclusion.' }
