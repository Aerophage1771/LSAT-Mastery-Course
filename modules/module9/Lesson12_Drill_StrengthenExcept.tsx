      { title: '(A) Horses are known to store oxygenated blood in their spleens for use during exertion.', text: 'This is a **Parallel Case**. It shows that the biological mechanism of using the spleen as a blood reservoir for exertion is not a wild fantasy; it already exists in another mammal. This makes it more plausible that seals could have evolved a similar adaptation.', badge: 'STRENGTHENS', badgeColor: 'red' },
      { title: '(B) Many species of seal can store oxygen directly in their muscle tissue.', text: 'This is an **Alternative Explanation**. If seals can store oxygen in their muscles, then you have another way to explain their diving ability that has nothing to do with the spleen. By providing a different, viable mechanism, this choice weakens the necessity of the spleen hypothesis. It gives you a reason to doubt that the spleen is the answer.', badge: 'CORRECT', badgeColor: 'green' },
      { title: '(C) The oxygen contained in the seals’ lungs and bloodstream alone would be inadequate to support the seals during their dives.', text: 'This shows **Necessity**. If the known oxygen sources (lungs and blood) are not enough, it proves that some *other* source must exist. This creates a "gap" that the spleen hypothesis is perfectly designed to fill, thus strengthening it.', badge: 'STRENGTHENS', badgeColor: 'red' },
      { title: '(D) The spleen is much larger in the Antarctic seal than in aquatic mammals that do not make long dives.', text: 'This is a **Correlation**. It links the specific adaptation (a large spleen) to the specific behavior (long dives). If the spleen were unrelated to diving, you wouldn\'t expect its size to correlate with diving ability. This suggests the spleen has an important function related to diving.', badge: 'STRENGTHENS', badgeColor: 'red' },
      { title: '(E) The spleens of Antarctic seals contain greater concentrations of blood vessels than are contained in most of their other organs.', text: 'This shows **Capability**. For the spleen to act as a blood reservoir, it would need to be highly vascularized (full of blood vessels).

    { type: 'callout', title: 'Key Takeaway', variant: 'summary', text: '"Strengthen EXCEPT" questions test your mental flexibility. You must recognize that support can come from multiple angles: analogy, necessity, physical capability, or correlation. The answer that fails to strengthen is often one that is either completely irrelevant or, as in this case, one that provides a compelling **alternative explanation**. If there is another way to explain the phenomenon, the original hypothesis becomes less necessary and is therefore not supported.' }
