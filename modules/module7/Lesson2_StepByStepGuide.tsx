      '**Out of Scope:** The answer choice discusses the general subject matter but fails to address the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. If the answer doesn\'t impact the conclusion\'s likelihood, it is irrelevant.',
      '**Weak Evaluators:** The answer choice touches on a relevant issue but lacks the power to prove or disprove the conclusion. It might provide a slight ""nudge"" (e.g., suggesting a minor cost or benefit), but it fails the **Variance Test** because it doesn\'t decisively strengthen or weaken the argument.',
      '**Questioning the Premise:** The answer choice asks if the evidence provided is actually true. In logical reasoning tests, you must accept the premises as factual; the error you are looking for is in the *reasoning* (the leap to the conclusion), not in the accuracy of the stated facts.',
      '**Misdirection:** The answer choice shifts the focus to a different subgroup, time period, or location than the one in the conclusion. For instance, if the conclusion makes a claim about ""all dogs,"" an answer choice focusing strictly on ""puppies"" is often likely a misdirection trap.'
