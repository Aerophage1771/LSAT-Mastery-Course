    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This is a high-difficulty question that exposes a common statistical trap: confusing a relative rank with an absolute quantity. An argument might present a high ranking (e.g., \"second place,\" \"top 10%\") as evidence of a large number, but this is a dangerous assumption. Without knowing the distribution of the data, a high rank can be misleading or even meaningless. This drill will teach you to be skeptical of arguments that rely on rankings without providing the actual numbers." },

The core of the reasoning is the inference that a high rank implies a high raw number." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "**What's the Problem?**\nThe flaw is the assumption that \"second place\" must mean a lot of votes. The distribution of votes could be extremely skewed. Consider a hypothetical scenario:\n\n*   Total Voters: 1,000\n*   Votes for the Bible (#1): 990\n*   Votes for *1984* (#2): 3\n*   Votes for *The Great Gatsby* (#3): 2\n*   Votes for 5 other books: 1 vote each\n\nIn this scenario, *1984* is still in second place, but it only received 3 votes. Is 3 \"a great number\"? No. The conclusion would be false. The entire argument hinges on how the votes for all the *other* books were distributed." },

Let's apply the Variance Test:\n*   Total people = 1,000.\n*   **Answer 1: \"A very high number\" (e.g., 997 people chose books other than *1984*).** If this is true, then only 3 people could have chosen *1984*. This would **destroy** the conclusion that it influenced a \"great number.\"\n*   **Answer 2: \"A lower number\" (e.g., 600 people chose books other than *1984*).** If this is true, then 400 people must have chosen *1984*. This would **strongly support** the conclusion.\nBecause the answer to this question forces a specific raw number for *1984* and makes the argument's validity swing, it is the correct choice.
