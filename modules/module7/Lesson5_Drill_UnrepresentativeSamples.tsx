This is a valid way to reason, but only if the example is a fair representation of the larger group. The \"Unrepresentative Sample\" flaw occurs when an author uses evidence from a biased or unique subgroup to draw a conclusion about a much broader category, assuming that what's true for the part must be true for the whole." },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: "**What's the Problem?**\nThe core weakness is the potential for an **unrepresentative sample**. The argument assumes, without any proof, that the extinction pattern for fish in North America is the same as the pattern for mammals in Africa, insects in Asia, and birds in South America. This is a massive logical leap. Fish might be uniquely vulnerable to a specific threat (like water pollution or dam construction) that doesn't affect other types of animals in the same way." },
    { type: 'h4', text: "Step 3: How Can We Evaluate?" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Since the entire argument rests on the assumption that North American fish are a good proxy for all animals, the most critical question we can ask is one that tests this assumption. We need to know if the sample is fair. The make-or-break question is: **\"Are fish special? Is their situation different from that of other animals?\"** If they are different, the evidence is useless for proving the general conclusion. If they are typical, the evidence is strong." },

It directly addresses the central flaw of the argument—the potential for a biased sample. Let's apply the Variance Test:\n*   **Answer 1: \"Yes, they were unrepresentative.\"** This means the fish are a special case. What happened to them doesn't tell us anything about other animals. This **destroys** the argument.\n*   **Answer 2: \"No, they were representative.\"** This means the trend seen in fish is typical for all animals. This **strongly supports** the argument.\nBecause the answer to this question makes the argument's validity swing, it is the best way to evaluate it. The fact that 86% of test-takers identified this shows it effectively targets the most obvious flaw.", badge: "Correct", badgeColor: "green" },
