An author will present an observation—something happened after a treatment or under certain conditions—and then conclude that the treatment *caused* that outcome.

An argument that shows you the \"after\" picture without showing you the \"before\" picture is making an enormous, unsupported assumption." },

It's a description of an experiment and its results. A group of rats was given a specific treatment (a high-salt diet), and a measurement was taken afterward. The key here is that the data is a snapshot in time—*after* the experiment began." },

It assumes that because the high blood pressure was observed *after* the diet started, it must have been *caused by* the diet." },

If that were true, the salt diet would have had no effect at all." },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Since the core problem is the missing baseline, the most powerful question you can ask is the one that seeks to establish that baseline. You need to know the starting point to know if a change even occurred. The critical question is: **\"What was the rats' blood pressure *before* they ate the high-salt diet?\"** The answer to this question will either validate the study's conclusion or render it completely meaningless." },

It asks about the *degree* of the cause, not whether it was a cause at all. Whether the salt amount was slightly high or extremely high, the core question remains: did it have any effect? This information doesn't help us determine the validity of the causal link. It's no surprise only 4% of test-takers chose this.", badge: "Incorrect", badgeColor: "red" },
      { title: "(B) Did the high blood pressure have any adverse health effects on those rats that developed it?", text: "This is **The Consequence Trap**.

This question is out of scope.", badge: "Incorrect", badgeColor: "red" },
      { title: "(C) What percentage of naturally occurring rat colonies feed on high-salt diets?", text: "This is **The Irrelevant Comparison Trap**.

      { title: "(D) How many rats in the colony studied had abnormally high blood pressure before the study began?", text: "This is the **Correct Choice**. It directly targets the missing baseline. Let's apply the Variance Test:\n*   **Answer 1: \"A high number\" (e.g., 75% already had high BP).** If this is true, the salt diet did nothing. The conclusion that salt is linked to high BP is completely undermined.\n*   **Answer 2: \"A low number\" (e.g., 0% had high BP).** If this is true, the study shows that introducing salt caused the rate of high blood pressure to jump from 0% to 75%. This provides powerful support for the conclusion.\nBecause the answer to this question determines whether the conclusion is strong or weak, it is the correct way to evaluate the argument.", badge: "Correct", badgeColor: "green" },

      "**Look for a Control Group:** If there's no information about the \"before,\" the next best thing is a control group—a similar group of subjects that *did not* receive the treatment. A question comparing the test group to a control group is also a powerful evaluation tool. This argument had neither, making the missing baseline the most glaring hole.",
