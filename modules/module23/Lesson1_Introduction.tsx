While not the most common type, they test a crucial high-level skill: abstract reasoning. Mastering analogies forces you to move beyond the surface content and identify the underlying logical structure of an argument or relationship. This skill is highly transferable and will strengthen your ability to recognize parallel reasoning in the Logical Reasoning section." },
