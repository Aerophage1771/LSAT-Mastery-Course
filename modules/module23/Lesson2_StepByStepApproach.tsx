The correct answer must be a perfect structural parallel." },

The correct answer and the original scenario should be interchangeable logical blueprints." },

Then, go back to the passage one last time and check which choice's unique element is a better match for the original scenario's logic. This simplifies your final decision by focusing only on what separates the two options." }
