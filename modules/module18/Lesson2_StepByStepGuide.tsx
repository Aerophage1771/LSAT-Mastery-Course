      '**Focus on Absolute Terms:** Prioritize words that establish strict, unbreakable rules. These "no-wiggle-room" terms are essential because they allow for no exceptions, making them the most effective anchors for proving a contradiction.\n    *   **Quantity words:** *All, every, none, no, always, never.*\n    *   **Relational words:** *If/then, only if, requires, must.*',
      '**Identify Probabilistic Terms:** Note words that allow for exceptions, such as *most, some, usually, often,* and *likely*. These terms are more difficult to disprove because they do not represent absolute certainties.',
      '**Sketch it out if it gets confusing:** For long step-by-step connections (e.g., If A happens, then B happens; if B happens, then C happens), quickly note the connection and its **contrapositive** (If C doesn\'t happen, then B didn\'t happen).'

      '**Chain Your Rules:** Connect your "If/Then" statements to find hidden requirements. For example, if "To be a Pilot requires Certification" and "Certification requires Passing the Exam," you can conclude that "To be a Pilot requires Passing the Exam." Any scenario where someone is a Pilot but did not Pass the Exam is now impossible.',
      '**Check for Conflict:** Determine if the rules prove that two things simply cannot happen at the same time. If "no reptiles have fur" and "all cats have fur," then it is strictly impossible for a cat to be a reptile.',
      '**Prephrase the "Impossible":** Before moving to the answers, finish this sentence: *"The one thing that absolutely cannot happen is..."* This becomes your **"Anti-Rule."**\n    *   *Example Stimulus:* "All obsidian samples are volcanic glass. No volcanic glass has a crystalline structure."\n    *   *Example Prephrase:* "An obsidian sample that has a crystalline structure."'

If the rules say "*X never happens*," and the answer choice says "*X happened*," you have found the correct answer.',
      '**The "Could Be True" Elimination:** For every other choice, ask: "Is there any way this *could* happen?" If you can dream up a scenario—no matter how unlikely—where the statement fits without breaking the rules, it is a wrong answer.'

      '**Trap: The "Could Be True" Statement.** These are statements about things the stimulus doesn\'t forbid. This includes statements that are Out of Scope or introduce New Information.',
      '**Trap: The "Must Be True" Statement.** These are often the most tempting traps. You correctly identify a strong logical connection, but fail to realize it is a result of the stimulus, not a contradiction of it.',
      '**Trap: Flawed Inferences.** The stimulus might say "If A, then B." A trap will suggest "If B, then A." While not guaranteed to be true, this reversal *could* be true and does not create a direct contradiction.',
      '**Trap: Exploiting Qualifiers.** A trap might describe an exception to a "most" or "usually" rule. Since the stimulus allows for exceptions, such a statement is possible and therefore not the answer.'
