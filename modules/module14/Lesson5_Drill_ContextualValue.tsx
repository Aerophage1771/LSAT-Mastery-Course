      "**\"But precisely because they lacked such ideas, they were able to respond quickly to the ideas of imaginative and difficult leaders.\"**\n*   **Reaction:** The word \"But\" signals a contrast. The author pivots to show the upside of the very same trait. In the context of *supporting a leader*, this trait becomes a strength, enabling a positive capability (responding quickly).",
