In these scenarios, an action, policy, or innovation is introduced to solve an initial problem. While it may be successful, it creates a new, often unforeseen, problem as a downstream effect. Your task is to recognize this causal chain and select the principle that describes it." },

Pay close attention to causal language (\"as a result of,\" \"resulting in,\" \"creating\").

The correct principle will describe this entire sequence, not just one part of it, and will avoid making overly strong or prescriptive claims." }
