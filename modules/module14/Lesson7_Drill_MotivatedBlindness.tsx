Your task is to identify the principle that describes this specific type of biased thinking, often called \"motivated blindness\" or \"willful ignorance.\"" },

Phrases like \"it is no wonder that\" or \"it is unsurprising that\" are strong clues that the stimulus is explaining a cognitive bias. The correct principle must match the specific mental process being described." }
