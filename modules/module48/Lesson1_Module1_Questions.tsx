After all, no flying machine closely modeled on birds has worked; workable aircraft are structurally very different from birds. **So thinking machines closely modeled on the brain are also likely to fail.** In developing a workable thinking machine, researchers would therefore increase their chances of success if they focus on the brain’s function and simply ignore its physical structure.' },
