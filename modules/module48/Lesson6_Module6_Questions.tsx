        '(B) We should not pick Hank for the relay team. He has not won a race all season, so there is no reason to expect him to help the relay team win.',
        '(C) Laws that contain exemptions for some individuals based on no relevant consideration are fundamentally immoral. If it is wrong for a given person to commit an act, then it is wrong for anyone else in similar circumstances to commit the act.',
        '(D) There is no point in asking the club to purchase tents and make them available for use by club members. No member of the club can afford one of those tents, so the club is unable to afford any either.',
        '(E) Agreeing with all of the other members of society does not guarantee that one is correct about an issue. With many topics it is possible for society to be mistaken and hence every individual in society to be likewise mistaken.'

        '(C) The majority of people who regularly drink coffee experience dental problems in the latter part of their lives. Since there is this correlation between drinking coffee and incurring dental problems, the government should make coffee less accessible to the general public.',
        '(D) Studies show that people who do not exercise regularly have a shorter life expectancy than those who exercise regularly. To help increase their patients’ life expectancy, doctors should recommend regular exercise to their patients.',
        '(E) Most people who exercise regularly are able to handle stress. This shows that exercising regularly decreases one’s chances of being overwhelmed by stress. So people who want to be able to handle stress should regularly engage in exercise.'

        '(A) Research shows that the incidence of certain major illnesses, including heart disease and cancer, is decreased in communities that have a modern power plant. The fact that this tendency is present whether the power plant is nuclear or not shows that there is no increased health risk associated with living next to a nuclear power plant.',
        '(B) Research has shown that there is no long-term health risk associated with a diet consisting largely of foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol if such a diet is consumed by someone with a physically active lifestyle. So, exercise is a more useful strategy for achieving cardiological health than is dietary restriction.',
        '(C) Research has shown that young people who drive motorcycles and receive one full year of extensive driving instruction are in fact less likely to become involved in accidents than those who simply pass a driving test and drive cars. This shows that there is not an inherently greater risk associated with driving a motorcycle than with driving a car.',
        '(D) Research has shown that kitchen cutting boards retain significant numbers of microbes even after careful washing, but that after washing fewer microbes are found on wooden boards than on plastic boards. There is, therefore, no greater risk of contracting microbial illnesses associated with using wooden cutting boards than with using plastic cutting boards.',
        '(E) Research shows that there is no greater long-term health benefit associated with taking vitamin supplements than with a moderate increase in the intake of fruits and vegetables. Clearly, then, there is no long-term health risk associated with the failure to take vitamin supplements, so long as enough fruits and vegetables are consumed.'
