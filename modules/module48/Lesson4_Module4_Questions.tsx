          '(A) If Ruth plants only daffodils, the squirrels will eat the bulbs. If the squirrels eat the bulbs, then no flowers will bloom in Ruth\'s garden. Since no flowers are blooming in Ruth\'s garden, she must have planted only daffodils.',
          '(B) If Shawn starts gardening in early spring, he can plant tomatoes early. If Shawn can plant tomatoes early, he will have plenty of tomatoes for canning. But he does not have plenty of tomatoes for canning, so either he did not start gardening in early spring or he did not plant tomatoes early.',
          '(C) Maria plants either petunias or geraniums in her garden. If Maria plants petunias, she plants purple ones. If Maria plants geraniums, she plants red ones. Since both petunias and geraniums are flowers, Maria will have either purple or red flowers in her garden.',
          '(D) If Li plants old rose varieties, her garden will look beautiful. If Li\'s garden looks beautiful, Li\'s neighbors will be impressed. So if Li plants old rose varieties, her neighbors will be impressed. (Correct)',
          '(E) If Bryan\'s fruit trees are to produce well, he must either prune them in the fall or fertilize them in the spring. Since Bryan wants his trees to produce well but forgot to prune them last fall, Bryan is sure to fertilize his trees this spring.'

          '(A) Samuel wants to take three friends to the beach. His mother owns both a sedan and a convertible. The convertible holds four people so, although the sedan has a more powerful engine, if Samuel borrows a vehicle from his mother, he will borrow the convertible.',
          '(B) If Anna wants to walk from her house to the office where she works, she must either go through the park or take the overpass across the railroad tracks. The park paths are muddy, and Anna does not like using the overpass, so she never walks to work.',
          '(C) Rose can either take a two-week vacation in July or wait until October and take a three-week vacation. The trail she had planned to hike requires three weeks to complete but is closed by October, so if Rose takes a vacation, it will not be the one she had planned.',
          '(D) Werdix, Inc., has offered Arno a choice between a job in sales and a job in research. Arno would like to work at Werdix but he would never take a job in sales when another job is available, so if he accepts one of these jobs, it will be the one in research. (Correct)',
          '(E) If Teresa does not fire her assistant, her staff will rebel and her department\'s efficiency will decline. Losing her assistant would also reduce its efficiency, so, if no alternative solution can be found, Teresa\'s department will become less efficient.'

          '(C) After Takashi told Sarah\'s parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah\'s parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.',
          '(D) After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case. (Correct)',
          '(E) Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff\'s financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.'
