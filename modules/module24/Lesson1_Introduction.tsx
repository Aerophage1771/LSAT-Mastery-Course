This question type is a true test of deep comprehension. Mastering it requires you to move beyond simply understanding what a principle says to understanding how it works. This ability to flexibly apply the logic of the passage to new scenarios will improve your performance on other complex question types that hinge on a nuanced understanding of the author's reasoning." }
