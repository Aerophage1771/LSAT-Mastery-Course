Go back to the passage and re-read the sentence(s) describing the rule, paying extremely close attention to every word. Is there a crucial qualifier you skimmed over (e.g., \"only if,\" \"primarily,\" \"unintended\")? Re-create your checklist with this stricter understanding and re-apply it to your final options. The deciding factor is often a single, precise word in the passage." },

Then, return to the passage one last time and check which choice's unique element is a better fit for the principle's specific language and logic. This narrows your final decision to a single, critical point of comparison." }
