    { type: 'paragraph', text: "One of the most sophisticated causal errors on the LSAT is what we might call the **Net Effect Flaw**, or the **\"Good with the Bad\" Fallacy**. This flaw occurs when an argument observes an overall positive outcome from a complex situation and incorrectly concludes that every single part of that situation must be either positive or neutral." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Imagine a cup of incredibly delicious, life-giving coffee that also happens to have one drop of poison in it. If the coffee is so powerful that its benefits far outweigh the harm of the poison, the person who drinks it might end up healthier overall. The Net Effect Flaw would be to look at that person and conclude, \"Well, they drank the coffee *and* the poison, and they got healthier, so the poison must be harmless.\"" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This is a powerful error because it hides a negative inside a larger positive. As you read the stimulus, look for this structure: an argument that takes a beneficial \"package deal\" and uses it to excuse a potentially harmful component." },

The studies may also be taken as showing, therefore, that there is no increased health risk associated with eating fruits and vegetables containing pesticide residues." },

      "(A) Research shows that the incidence of certain major illnesses, including heart disease and cancer, is decreased in communities that have a modern power plant. The fact that this tendency is present whether the power plant is nuclear or not shows that there is no increased health risk associated with living next to a nuclear power plant.",
      "(B) Research has shown that there is no long-term health risk associated with a diet consisting largely of foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol if such a diet is consumed by someone with a physically active lifestyle. So, exercise is a more useful strategy for achieving cardiological health than is dietary restriction.",
      "(C) Research has shown that young people who drive motorcycles and receive one full year of extensive driving instruction are in fact less likely to become involved in accidents than those who simply pass a driving test and drive cars. This shows that there is not an inherently greater risk associated with driving a motorcycle than with driving a car.",
      "(D) Research has shown that kitchen cutting boards retain significant numbers of microbes even after careful washing, but that after washing fewer microbes are found on wooden boards than on plastic boards. There is, therefore, no greater risk of contracting microbial illnesses associated with using wooden cutting boards than with using plastic cutting boards.",
      "(E) Research shows that there is no greater long-term health benefit associated with taking vitamin supplements than with a moderate increase in the intake of fruits and vegetables. Clearly, then, there is no long-term health risk associated with the failure to take vitamin supplements, so long as enough fruits and vegetables are consumed."
