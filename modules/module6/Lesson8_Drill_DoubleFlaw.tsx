    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The most difficult Parallel Flaw questions on the LSAT rarely test a single, simple error. Instead, they engineer a special kind of complexity by layering one flaw on top of another. An argument might be broken in two places at once, and your job is to find an answer choice that is similarly broken in both ways." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "One of the most sophisticated traps the LSAT sets is the **Epistemic Flaw**, which explores the gap between objective reality and a person's subjective knowledge. In the real world, a rule might be true (e.g., \"If you have a winning ticket, you can claim the prize\"). But in the world of the mind, a person might have the ticket without *knowing* it's a winner. They might not even know the prize exists." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This drill features a classic \"Double Flaw.\" On the surface, it contains a simple error in conditional logic. But hidden underneath is a deeper, epistemic error about what a person can logically be said to *know*. To solve this, you must diagnose both problems." },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: "First, let's analyze the conditional rule itself, ignoring the \"knowing\" for a moment. \"Bank deposits are credited... **only when** they are made before 3 P.M.\" The phrase \"only when\" (like \"only if\") introduces a **necessary condition**. This means if a deposit was credited today, it *must have been* made before 3 P.M. The rule is: **Credited Today $\\rightarrow$ Before 3 PM**" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The argument then tells us the deposit was made \"before 3 P.M.\" and concludes that it was \"credited today.\" This is a classic **Mistaken Reversal**. It confuses a requirement for a guarantee. Just because a necessary condition is met doesn't mean the outcome is assured; maybe the bank's computers were down or it was a holiday." },
    { type: 'h4', text: "Step 2: Diagnose the Deeper Flaw (The Epistemic Trap)" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Now, let's add the \"knowledge\" component back in. \"Alicia **knows** that the bank deposit was made before 3 P.M. So, Alicia **knows** that the bank deposit was credited...\" Even if the conditional logic were valid, there's a second flaw here. The argument assumes that because Alicia knows a fact (the deposit was early), she must also know the logical conclusion of that fact. But does she? For Alicia to \"know\" the outcome, she would have to know two things:\n1. The fact (the time of the deposit).\n2. The bank's internal rule connecting the time to the credit date." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The argument only gives us #1. It illicitly assumes #2. We cannot conclude what someone *knows* without establishing that they know both the premise *and* the rule that governs it." },

The rule is (Works $\\rightarrow$ Thursday). The evidence is (Today is Thursday). The conclusion is (Works). However, it is missing the second flaw. The argument is about what *we* know and conclude; it doesn't make an assumption about *Patrice's* knowledge.", badge: "Incorrect", badgeColor: "red" },

It contains the **Mistaken Reversal** (just because Helen resigns doesn't guarantee George gets the promotion). And it contains the **Epistemic Flaw** (it assumes George knows the company rule linking Helen's resignation to his promotion).", badge: "Correct", badgeColor: "green" },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: "When a question stem alerts you that there are **\"both\"** flaws, you are on a hunt for two specific, independent errors. The most common trap is an answer choice that contains one of the flaws but not the other." },

      "**Separate the Flaws:** First, diagnose the pure logical error (in this case, a Mistaken Reversal). Then, diagnose the second error, which is often more subtle (in this case, the Epistemic leap).",
      "**Look for the Mental State:** If the stimulus uses words like \"knows,\" \"believes,\" or \"intends,\" your first step in evaluating the answer choices should be to look for ones that also use mental state language. This quickly narrows the field. Choice (B) was a powerful distractor because it matched the logic but dropped the \"knowledge\" component about the agent."
