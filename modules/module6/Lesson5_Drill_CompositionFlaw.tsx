This ignores the fact that a society or group might have rights, abilities, or properties that a single person does not. Just as a choir can sing a chord even though a single singer cannot, a society might be morally permitted to govern even if a single dictator is not." },

(Composition)\n*   Did the author go **Big $\\rightarrow$ Small**? (Division)\n\nIn this drill, the Historian went Small (Individual) to Big (Society).
