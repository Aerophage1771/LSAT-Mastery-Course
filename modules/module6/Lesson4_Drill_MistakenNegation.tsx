    { type: 'paragraph', text: "One of the most intimidating question types on the LSAT is the **Parallel Flaw**. These questions ask you to do three difficult things at once: diagnose a logical error in the stimulus, abstract that error into a structural blueprint, and then find a matching error in a completely different context." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "However, the secret to mastering these questions is realizing that the LSAT relies on a very small set of repeating logical mistakes. You don't need to be a philosopher to solve them; you just need to be a pattern recognizer." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Today, we are going to look at one of the most fundamental errors in conditional logic: the **Mistaken Negation**. This flaw occurs when an author takes a rule—like \"If you are a doctor, you are smart\"—and wrongly assumes that if the first part isn't true, the second part can't be true either (\"You aren't a doctor, so you aren't smart\"). In the real world, we know this is silly; there are plenty of smart people who aren't doctors. But on the LSAT, this specific structural error appears constantly. Your job in this drill is to look past the topic of the argument and find this specific broken skeleton." },

The city might have an obligation to provide trash cans for a totally different reason, like keeping the streets clean or improving public health. The argument assumes that the stated condition is the *only* way to trigger the result, which is not justified." },
