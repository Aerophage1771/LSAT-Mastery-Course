These questions test your understanding of quantifiers—words like \"all,\" \"some,\" and \"most\"—and how groups and subgroups relate to one another." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The specific error in this drill is the **Overlap Flaw**. This happens when an argument concludes that two groups *must* have members in common, when in fact they only *might*. Think of it like a Venn diagram. If you have a big circle (\"Tenured Professors\") and you know a smaller circle (\"Linguistics Professors\") is entirely inside it, you can't assume that the Linguistics circle touches every single part of the bigger circle." },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: "\"Therefore... not all of the faculty members in the linguistics department are full professors.\" The conclusion claims that the Linguistics subgroup *must* overlap with the \"Not Full Professor\" property. But is this guaranteed? No. It's possible that all the \"Not Full Professors\" are in the History department (which also has tenure), and every single member of the Linguistics department happens to be a Full Professor. The argument takes a property of the larger group and forces it onto a subgroup without justification." },

All (Government buildings) are (Famous Architect buildings). Therefore, Some (Government buildings) are (Not well proportioned).\nThis is a perfect structural match.
