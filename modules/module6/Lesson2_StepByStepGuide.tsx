This is a common high-level trap designed to lure students who are only looking for topical similarities.',
        '**Does it commit the same flaw?** Apply your Reasoning Map from Step 1B. The correct answer must replicate the precise ""logical leap"" made in the stimulus. If the stimulus committed a Mistaken Reversal (confusing necessity for sufficiency), the correct choice must also move from the fulfillment of a necessary condition to the claim that the sufficient condition is met. The relationship between the terms must be identical in its failure.',
        '**Are there multiple flaws?** While rarer, some stimuli contain more than one logical issue—for example, a Mistaken Reversal paired with a Causal error. If the stimulus contains two distinct flaws, the correct answer choice must also contain those same two flaws. Wrong answer choices will often feature one of the flaws but not the other, or swap one out for a ""decoy"" error. This highlights the importance of attempting to eliminate every wrong choice rather than simply picking the first one that ""looks"" right; if you find a partial overlap, keep searching for the full structural match unless you can determine why each other choice is even worse.'
