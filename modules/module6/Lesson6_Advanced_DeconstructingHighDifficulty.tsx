    { type: 'paragraph', text: "On the LSAT, hard questions are not just harder; they are tricky in specific, predictable ways. When we look at highly difficult Parallel Flaw questions, we see the test-makers using a few key tactics to hide the flaw and make the right answer difficult to spot." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "To master these tough questions, we need to look past the surface and understand these tactics. Three of the most common are: **The \"Knowing vs. Being True\" Trap**, **The \"Topic\" Trap**, and **The \"Overlap\" Trap**." },
    { type: 'hr' },
    { type: 'h3', text: "1. The \"Knowing vs. Being True\" Trap" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Simple logic deals with facts: If A happens, then B happens. But harder questions add a layer of confusion by talking about what a person *knows* or *believes*. The mistake is to treat a person's knowledge the same as a fact. Just because a rule is true, and a person knows the first part of that rule, doesn't mean they know the outcome. They might not even be aware of the rule itself." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The hardest questions will mix a normal logic flaw (like flipping a rule backwards) with this \"knowing\" flaw. To get the question right, you have to find an answer choice that is broken in **both** ways. Many wrong answers will have only one of the two flaws, making them tempting but incorrect." },
    { type: 'hr' },
    { type: 'h3', text: "2. The \"Topic\" Trap: Ignoring the Vibe" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The LSAT often hides a simple flaw inside a complicated, serious-sounding topic. When we read an argument about the philosophy of government, we naturally look for an answer choice that also feels serious, like one about law or ethics." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The test-makers know this. They will often make the correct answer about a simple, everyday topic, like buying tents for a club. This forces you to ignore the \"vibe\" of the topic and focus only on the pure structure of the reasoning. A flaw is a flaw, whether it's about democracy or cooking. The key is to realize that the logic does not care about the subject matter." },
    { type: 'hr' },
    { type: 'h3', text: "3. The \"Overlap\" Trap: Confusing \"Some\" and \"Most\"" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The most complex Parallel Flaw questions often use words like \"all,\" \"some,\" and \"most.\" The error in these arguments comes from assuming that two groups must have members in common just because they share a certain feature." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Think of it this way: Some doctors are tall, and some basketball players are tall. Does that mean that some doctors must be basketball players? No. The tall doctors and the tall basketball players could be two completely separate groups of people. The language in these questions is designed to sound reasonable, but when you try to picture the groups (like in a Venn diagram), you realize the argument doesn't actually prove the groups overlap." }
