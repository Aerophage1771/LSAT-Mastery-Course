When a paradox seems to violate basic mathematics or logic (e.g., a single group having two different sizes), do not question the math itself. Instead, question the definitions. The LSAT is testing your ability to notice that the stimulus may be comparing apples and oranges—or in this case, a *count* of garments to a *weight* of garments. Always ask, \"Are we measuring the same thing in the same way?\"" }
