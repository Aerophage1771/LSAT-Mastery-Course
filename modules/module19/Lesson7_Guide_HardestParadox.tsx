    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The hardest Paradox questions move beyond simple, one-step explanations. They require you to analyze complex systems, notice subtle distinctions in language, or consider second- and third-order effects. These questions are difficult not because the paradox is unsolvable, but because the correct answer hinges on a precise and often non-obvious logical mechanism. The most difficult paradoxes fall into three advanced categories." },
    { type: 'h4', text: "Category 1: The Hidden Distinction" },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "These paradoxes hinge on a subtle but crucial difference between two concepts that the stimulus treats as similar. The conflict disappears once you realize that the two clashing facts are not actually measuring the same thing. The resolution lies in identifying this unstated difference." },

        "**Scrutinize the Nouns:** Pay extremely close attention to the exact terms used. Is the stimulus talking about \"profits\" or \"sales\"? \"Number of accidents\" or \"fatality rate\"? \"Preventing\" an action or making it \"illegal\"? The entire paradox may turn on a single word choice.",
        "**Ask \"Are these truly the same?\":** The moment you see a potential distinction—such as measurement by count versus measurement by weight, or total costs versus material costs—focus on it. The resolution will likely exploit that difference.",
        "**Challenge Definitions:** The paradox may arise from a faulty assumption about a term. For example, if a food has more nutrients *per calorie*, the resolution might be that the processing changes what counts as a \"calorie\" (e.g., by making some of them indigestible)."

        "**Look for a \"Net Effect\":** The stimulus will describe a primary, expected effect but a surprising overall result. Your job is to find a hidden secondary effect that is stronger than the primary one, thus changing the final outcome.",
        "**Think Systemically:** Real-world systems have feedback loops and multiple actors. Ask: \"Who or what else is affected by this change?\" An action intended to influence one group might change the behavior of another group in a way that reverses the outcome.",
        "**Identify the Unseen Actor:** A paradox is often resolved by considering the behavior of a party not immediately obvious in the conflict. For example, an action by a company might be intended to affect its workers, but the resolution might hinge on how its *clients* react instead."

    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The most difficult \"EXCEPT\" questions present four valid resolutions and one distractor that is subtly flawed.

        "**Isolate the Outlier:** The correct answer in a hard \"EXCEPT\" question will often:\n*   **Explain the Opposite:** It might provide a reason why the expected result *should have* happened, thereby deepening the mystery.\n*   **Describe a Component, Not the Cause:** It will accurately state a fact related to the situation but will not provide the causal link needed to explain *why* the surprising outcome occurred.\n*   **Be Logically Irrelevant:** It talks about a different group, a different timeline, or a different effect entirely, and thus fails to engage with the core conflict."
