    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This drill tackles a sophisticated paradox involving economic incentives and human behavior. The situation seems to defy logic: the scenario with the *weaker* incentive for bad behavior actually produces *more* of that bad behavior. Resolving this requires you to look beyond the most obvious actor in the system and consider how the incentives change the behavior of *everyone* involved." },

One kind of cost-plus contract stipulates the contractor’s profit as a fixed percentage of the contractor’s costs; the other kind stipulates a fixed amount of profit over and above costs. Under the first kind of contract, higher costs yield higher profits for the contractor, so this is where one might expect final costs in excess of original cost estimates to be more common. Paradoxically, such cost overruns are actually more common if the contract is of the fixed-profit kind." },
