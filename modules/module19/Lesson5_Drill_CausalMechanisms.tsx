The paradox is resolved by identifying an unknown causal mechanism--typically a behavioral side effect--that reverses the expected benefit. On the LSAT, the most common hidden mechanism is **Risk Compensation**: a technical safety improvement causes humans to behave more recklessly, producing a net negative result.' },
