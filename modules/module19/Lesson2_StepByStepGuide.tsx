      '**Trap: The Worsener.** This trap introduces information that makes the conflict even harder to understand. Instead of resolving the mystery, it adds a new reason why the *expected* outcome should have occurred, rendering the actual result even more illogical.',
      '**Trap: The Irrelevant Distraction.** This trap provides information that is technically true but completely unrelated to the specific conflict at hand. It often shifts focus to different groups, comparable situations, or other time periods that have no bearing on the relationship between Fact 1 and Fact 2.',
      '**Trap: The Opposite.** This trap explains the wrong direction. It gives a logical reason for the *expected* result to happen, rather than providing the necessary cause for the *unexpected* result that actually occurred.'
