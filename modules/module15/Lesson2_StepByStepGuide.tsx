        '**Trap: Out of Scope.** The answer brings in a new idea, a different topic, or an irrelevant detail. It\'s a distraction that doesn\'t actually connect to the specific argument being made.',

        '**Trap: Bad Comparison.** The answer makes a comparison to something else, but it focuses on silly similarities instead of the core logic.'
