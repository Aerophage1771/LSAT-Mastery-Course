These arguments typically conclude that a person or entity is blameworthy (or not blameworthy) for a negative outcome. The evidence centers on that person's professional role, their state of knowledge, or their relationship to the harm. The unstated rule is a **standard of care** — a general principle defining when ignorance, good intentions, or other excuses are valid defenses against blame." },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This is a distinct principle type because the gap is not between a factual observation and a general value judgment (Normative Bridge), nor between a cost comparison and a choice (Efficiency). Instead, it is between a **person's situation** (role, knowledge, actions) and a **judgment of responsibility** (blame, duty, obligation). The argument assumes that the person's position creates a duty that overrides the excuse they offer." },

      { title: '"A favorable biography of a politician omits certain incriminating facts about the politician that were available to anyone when the book was written."', text: "These are the core facts of the situation. Three critical details are established: (1) the biography is favorable, (2) incriminating facts were omitted, and (3) those facts were publicly available — \"available to anyone.\" The public availability is the key factual predicate that will drive the entire argument." },
      { title: '"The book\u2019s author claims that, because he was unaware of these facts when he wrote the book, he is not accountable for the fact that readers were misled by this omission."', text: "This is the biographer's defense. He uses personal ignorance (\"I didn't know\") as a shield against blame. His logic: I wasn't aware → my omission was innocent → I'm not accountable. This is the position the passage will reject." },
      { title: '"In a biographer, however, ignorance of this kind cannot be used to evade blame for misleading readers."', text: "This is the main conclusion. The word \"however\" signals the pivot — the passage rejects the biographer's defense and asserts that he *is* to blame. The phrase \"ignorance of this kind\" is crucial: it refers specifically to ignorance of publicly available facts, not ignorance in general. The passage establishes a special standard for biographers: when information is publicly available, professional duty demands awareness." },

    ]},
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The premises establish what the biographer did and what information was available. The conclusion assigns blame. The logical leap is from \"the biographer omitted publicly available facts\" to \"the biographer is blameworthy despite claiming ignorance.\" The argument assumes an unstated standard of care: that biographers have a professional duty to be aware of publicly available information, and that ignorance of such information is not a valid defense." },
    { type: 'callout', variant: 'default', title: 'Classifying the Gap', text: "This is a **Role → Duty** gap. The evidence identifies a person's professional role (biographer) and a specific factual circumstance (publicly available facts were omitted). The conclusion assigns blame. The bridge needed is an accountability principle: a rule stating that biographers are responsible for knowing publicly available facts, regardless of whether they actually knew them." },

The biographer claims he was unaware of the facts, meaning the omission was not deliberate. Under this principle, only *deliberate* omissions warrant blame — so the biographer would be off the hook. This directly contradicts the passage's argument that ignorance is no excuse.\n\n**Why it fails:** It is a Contradiction trap. It validates the very defense the passage rejects.", badge: 'Contradiction', badgeColor: 'red' },

Since the facts were public, this principle would *exonerate* the biographer.\n\n**Why it fails:** It is another Contradiction trap.

It establishes the exact standard of care the argument needs: when facts are \"widely available,\" the biographer is to blame for omitting them — regardless of personal awareness. The key phrase \"widely available\" directly maps to the stimulus's \"available to anyone.\" Under this principle, the biographer's ignorance defense collapses: his duty as a biographer includes knowing what is publicly accessible.\n\nNotice how the principle is general enough to apply beyond this specific case — it establishes a universal rule for all biographers and all publicly available facts.", badge: 'Correct', badgeColor: 'green' },

    { type: 'callout', variant: 'summary', title: 'Key Takeaways', text: "**1. Accountability Principles establish a \"Standard of Care\" that invalidates common excuses.** When an argument assigns blame despite an excuse (like ignorance), the strengthening principle must formalize *why* the excuse fails. In this case, the principle states that public availability of facts creates a duty to know them.\n\n**2. Watch for Contradiction traps — answers that support the wrong side.** Both (B) and (D) use the right vocabulary (biographer, blame, omitting facts) but reach conclusions that support the biographer's defense rather than the passage's argument. Always check: does this principle support or undermine the conclusion?\n\n**3. Match the specific conditions in the stimulus precisely.** The key detail is \"available to anyone.\" The correct answer uses \"widely available\" — a near-perfect match. Wrong answers substitute different conditions (\"deliberately,\" \"author alone had access\") that fundamentally change the principle's application.\n\n**4. The claim–defense–rebuttal structure is a hallmark of accountability arguments.** When a stimulus presents someone's excuse and then rejects it, the strengthening principle will typically formalize why that type of excuse is invalid for that type of role.\n\n**5. Role-based accountability principles often create constructive knowledge duties.** A biographer is held to a different standard than a casual reader — the principle assigns a professional duty to discover what is publicly available, even when the biographer personally failed to discover it. This \"you should have known\" standard is the essence of the accountability gap." },
