Think of this as a Strengthen question where all the answer choices are written as broad, general rules, often in an ""if-then"" format. The correct answer provides a general rule that connects the argument\'s evidence to its conclusion, making the reasoning more defensible.' },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**Matching the Argument\'s Blueprint**\n\nA principle is a universal statement that strips away the specific details of the stimulus (e.g., ""the mayor,"" ""the tax"") and replaces them with general categories (e.g., ""a public official,"" ""a policy""). To find the correct principle, you must identify the argument\'s logical blueprint and find the rule that matches it.' },

Therefore, the factory should not be built.""\n*   **Blueprint:** A specific action (building the factory) has a specific negative consequence (pollution). The author concludes the action should not be taken.\n*   **Strengthening Principle:** ""Any project that will cause significant environmental pollution should not be undertaken.""' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**How the Principle Strengthens**\nThe correct principle closes a logical gap in the argument. The author often assumes a connection between their evidence and conclusion but doesn\'t state it. The principle provides this missing link. By supplying the general rule, it makes the conclusion follow much more strongly from the premises. It answers the implicit ""So what?"" that exists between the evidence and the conclusion.'}
