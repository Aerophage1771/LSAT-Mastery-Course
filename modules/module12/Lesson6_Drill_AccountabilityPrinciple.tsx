    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The third type of Principle question we will discuss involves accountability and professional duty. These arguments often conclude that a person should be blamed or held responsible for a negative outcome. The evidence usually centers on that person\'s specific role (like a doctor, journalist, or, in this case, a biographer) and their state of knowledge.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'This creates a logical gap between the person\'s actions (or inaction) and the judgment that they are at fault. The argument assumes a "Standard of Care"—an unstated rule that people in certain professional roles have a duty to know or do certain things. We want to be able to recognize what type of principle is needed to justify holding someone accountable based on their professional obligations.' },

      '**"The book’s author claims that, because he was unaware of these facts when he wrote the book, he is not accountable for the fact that readers were misled by this omission."**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the biographer\'s defense.

The argument needs a principle that establishes this professional standard of care.' },

Pay close attention to the specific conditions mentioned in the stimulus (like "widely available" facts) and make sure the principle you choose matches those conditions precisely.' }
