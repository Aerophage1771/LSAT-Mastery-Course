      '**"In one study, engineering students who prepared for an exam by using toothpicks and string did no worse than similar students who prepared by using an expensive computer with sophisticated graphics."**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the first piece of evidence. It presents a scenario where a cheap, low-tech tool was just as effective as an expensive, high-tech one.',

It moves from the factual observation that "expensive was no better than cheap" to the value judgment that "one should not purchase the expensive tool."

It sets a necessary condition for justifying an expensive purchase: the absence of a cheaper, equally good alternative. The stimulus provides two examples where this condition was not met (a cheaper, equally good alternative *did* exist), which strongly supports the conclusion that one should not *always* buy the expensive option.', badge: 'Correct', badgeColor: 'green' },

The strengthening principle must provide the rule for making that choice. These principles often take the form of a conditional statement, such as "Do not do X unless Y is true." The evidence then shows that Y is not true, justifying the conclusion to not do X.' }
