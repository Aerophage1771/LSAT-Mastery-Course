    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The first type of Principle question we will discuss involves the "is-ought" gap. Normative arguments make claims about what is right, wrong, moral, or what someone *should* do. These arguments often present factual evidence and then leap to a moral or ethical conclusion. This jump from "what is" to "what ought to be" is a logical gap.' },

      '**"since using force causes harm to another person..."**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a factual premise that connects the act of "using force" to the category of "causing harm." This allows the author to apply the initial moral rule to the specific action of using force.',
      '**"...it is also immoral to threaten to use force, even when such a threat is made in self-defense."**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the main conclusion. The author extends the moral judgment about using force to *threatening* to use force. This is the argument\'s major logical leap.'

    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**What\'s the Problem?**\nThe author assumes that the morality of an action automatically transfers to the morality of threatening that action. While this might seem intuitive, it is an unstated logical link. The argument never provides a rule that connects the ethics of an act to the ethics of a threat. This is the gap that needs to be filled.' },

      { title: '(B) It is immoral to threaten to do what it is immoral to do.', text: 'This principle provides the exact logical bridge the argument needs.

Reversal traps are a common and tempting distractor in this type of question." }
