Instead, it acknowledges a conflict between two imperfect options and concludes that we must choose the "lesser of two evils." This requires a principle that doesn\'t just support the conclusion, but justifies the author\'s choice of which potential error is more acceptable.' },

      '**"Many people believe that the punishment of those who commit even the most heinous crimes should be mitigated to some extent if the crime was motivated by a sincere desire to achieve some larger good."**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the opposing viewpoint the theorist will argue against.',
      '**"Granted, some criminals with admirable motives deserve mitigated punishments."**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a critical concession. The theorist admits that, in a perfect world where we had perfect knowledge, mitigating punishment for good motives would be the right thing to do. This sets up the core conflict.',
      '**"Nonetheless, judges should never mitigate punishment on the basis of motives..."**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the main conclusion. Despite the concession, the theorist advocates for an absolute, inflexible rule against considering motives.',
      '**"...since motives are essentially a matter of conjecture and even vicious motives can easily be presented as altruistic."**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the evidence. The reasoning is practical: we can\'t reliably know a person\'s true motives, because they are internal ("conjecture") and can be faked.'

    { type: 'paragraph', text: '**What Method of Reasoning is the argument using?**\nThe argument is a "lesser of two evils" justification. The theorist identifies two flawed potential systems for sentencing:\n*   **System 1: Consider Motives.** This system attempts to achieve perfect justice by mitigating punishment for those with "admirable motives." The theorist admits this is a worthy goal. **The Risk:** Because motives can be faked, this system will inevitably make errors of **leniency**, letting a vicious criminal receive a lighter sentence than they deserve.\n*   **System 2: Never Consider Motives.** This system avoids the risk of being deceived. **The Cost:** This system will inevitably make errors of **severity**, giving a harsher sentence than deserved to those "criminals with admirable motives" who the theorist admits *should* receive mitigation.\nThe theorist\'s conclusion is to choose System 2. The argument\'s logical gap is the unstated reason *why* the error of severity is preferable to the error of leniency.' },

The principle must justify the choice to accept guaranteed harshness for some in order to avoid the possibility of undue leniency for others.

      { title: '(A) Laws that prohibit or permit actions solely on the basis of psychological states should not be part of a legal system.', text: 'This is very tempting. "Motives" are a psychological state. However, the theorist\'s reason for rejecting motives isn\'t because they are psychological states in general, but because they are *unknowable* and *can be faked*. This principle is too broad and doesn\'t capture the specific risk-based reasoning of the argument.', badge: 'The Topically-Relevant Trap', badgeColor: 'red' },
      { title: '(B) It is better to err on the side of overly severe punishment than to err on the side of overly lenient punishment.', text: 'This principle perfectly captures the "lesser of two evils" logic. It directly addresses the choice between the two flawed systems. It provides the value judgment that the argument needs: the error of leniency (letting a vicious criminal off easy) is a worse outcome than the error of severity (punishing a well-intentioned criminal too harshly). This justifies the theorist\'s decision to adopt the "never mitigate" rule.', badge: 'Correct', badgeColor: 'green' },
      { title: '(C) The legal permissibility of actions should depend on the perceivable consequences of those actions.', text: 'This is another tempting trap because it focuses on what is "perceivable," which seems related to the "conjecture" about motives. However, the stimulus is about how to determine *punishment*, not about the "legal permissibility of actions." The crime has already been committed and is impermissible; the question is how to sentence the criminal.', badge: 'The Scope Mismatch', badgeColor: 'red' },
      { title: '(D) No law that cannot be enforced should be enacted.', text: 'The argument is not about the *enforcement* of laws but about the *sentencing guidelines* judges should use after a conviction.', badge: 'The Irrelevant Issue', badgeColor: 'red' },
      { title: '(E) A legal system that, if adopted, would have disastrous consequences ought not be adopted.', text: 'The theorist never claims that allowing mitigation would be "disastrous." The argument is about making errors in individual cases, not causing a systemic disaster. This principle is too extreme and doesn\'t match the nuanced reasoning.', badge: 'The Extreme Language Trap', badgeColor: 'red' }

    { type: 'callout', variant: 'summary', title: 'Key Takeaway', text: 'For difficult Principle-Strengthen questions, you must look beyond simple topical relevance and analyze the *structure* of the reasoning. When an argument concedes a point but then makes a hardline conclusion to avoid a practical problem, it is often making a "lesser of two evils" choice. The strengthening principle will not be a simple rule, but a meta-rule that tells you which kind of error is more acceptable.' }
