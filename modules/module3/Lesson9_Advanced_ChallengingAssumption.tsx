A powerful way to attack such an argument is to identify this hidden premise and show that it's false. This collapses the entire logical structure." },

If an argument seems to jump from evidence to a conclusion, ask: \"What must the author believe for this to make sense?\" That's the unstated assumption.\n*   **Distinguish Stated vs. Implicit Premises:** The LSAT makes a sharp distinction between what is written on the page (stated) and what is logically required but not written (implicit/unstated).\n*   **How to Spot This Method:** A speaker will often agree with an opponent's stated evidence but then introduce a new piece of information that seems to come out of nowhere. This new information is often the denial of a hidden assumption." }
