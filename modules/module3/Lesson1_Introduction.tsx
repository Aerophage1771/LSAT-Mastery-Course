    { type: 'paragraph', text: "Method of Reasoning acts as a bridge between basic identification tasks (like Argument Parts) and complex evaluation tasks (like Flaw or Weaken questions). While an Argument Part question asks you to identify the role of a specific statement, a Method question asks you to describe how the entire argument is constructed. Mastering the ability to look past the details and see the argument's underlying structure is critical for success on advanced question types. For example, before you can identify and fix a flawed analogy, you must first recognize that the argument's method *is* using an analogy. You can only evaluate an argument's validity after you understand how its parts fit together." },
