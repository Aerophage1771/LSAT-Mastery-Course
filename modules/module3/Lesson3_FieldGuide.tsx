While arguments can seem unique, most fall into a handful of strategic categories. This guide will help you identify the most common patterns and the language used to describe them in the answer choices." },

      '**Description:** The author makes a point about one thing by comparing it to another.',
      '**Common Variations:**',
      '  • **Supportive Analogy:** Because two things are similar in one way, they are likely similar in another. The known case supports a conclusion about the unknown case.',
      '  • **Refutation by Analogy:** An opponent\'s reasoning is applied to a different situation where it produces an absurd conclusion, showing the original reasoning is flawed.',
      '  • **Attacking an Analogy:** An author weakens an analogy by pointing out a crucial *difference* between the two things being compared.',
      '**How to Spot It:** Look for comparative language like "just as," "similarly," or "it would be like." In a dialogue, look for a second speaker saying, "By your logic..." or "But A and B are different because..."'

    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** The author argues for or against a proposal by focusing on its outcomes.',
      '**Common Variations:**',
      '  • **Negative Consequences:** Argues against a plan by showing it will lead to a harmful, undesirable, or counterproductive result.',
      '  • **Proof by Contradiction:** To disprove a claim, the author assumes it is true and shows this assumption leads to a consequence that is false or logically impossible.',
      '**How to Spot It:** Look for predictions about what *would* happen if a plan were implemented. For contradictions, look for the structure: "Suppose X were true. Then Y would have to be true. But Y is false. Therefore, X must be false."'

    { type: 'h4', text: '3. Causal Reasoning & Explanations (~14%)' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** These arguments focus on the *cause* of an observed event or phenomenon.',
      '**Common Variations:**',
      '  • **Alternative Explanation:** The author agrees that a phenomenon occurred but offers a different cause for it than the one proposed by someone else.',
      '  • **Weakening a Causal Claim:** The author challenges a cause-and-effect conclusion by showing the effect occurs even without the proposed cause.',
      '**How to Spot It:** The argument will often have the structure: "Some say X caused Y. However, it is more likely that Z caused Y."'

    { type: 'h4', text: '4. Challenging an Unstated Assumption (~11%)' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** A sophisticated rebuttal where the author attacks the logical foundation of an argument by exposing a hidden weakness. The author identifies a necessary but unstated premise in an argument and provides evidence to show that this assumption is false.',
      '**How to Spot It:** The second speaker does not attack the stated evidence. Instead, they introduce a new piece of information that breaks the logical link between the first speaker\'s evidence and conclusion. The correct answer will often use words like "assumption," "presupposition," or "premise."'

    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** The argument is structured around the application of a general rule, definition, or principle to a specific case.',
      '**How to Spot It:** The argument moves from a broad statement ("All X are Y") to a specific one ("This is an X, so it must be Y"), or it uses a specific example to establish a broad principle. Look for definitional language or appeals to authority.'

    { type: 'h4', text: '6. Process of Elimination (~6%)' },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** This strategy reaches a conclusion by showing it is the only viable option remaining. The author identifies a limited set of possible explanations and then systematically provides reasons to reject all but one of them.',
      '**How to Spot It:** The argument will often list several possibilities and then use words like "but" or "however" to discard them. The final conclusion is presented as the only one left.'

    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**Description:** A direct and powerful way to disprove a general claim. The author refutes a universal claim ("All X are Y") by providing a single, specific instance where the claim is false.',
      '**How to Spot It:** The argument will state a general rule and then pivot to a specific case that violates that rule. One valid counterexample is sufficient to disprove a universal claim.'
