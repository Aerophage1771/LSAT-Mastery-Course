To prove a claim is false, you temporarily assume it's true. You then show that this assumption leads to a conclusion or consequence that is impossible, absurd, or factually incorrect. This contradiction proves that the initial assumption must have been false." },

Since most people with colds wish to recover quickly, it follows that almost everybody with a cold would be using it. Therefore, since there are many people who have colds but do not use the mixture, it is obviously not effective.”" },
