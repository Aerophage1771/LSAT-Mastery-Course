      { title: 'Highlighting Consequences', text: 'Argues against a plan by showing it will lead to a harmful, absurd, or counterproductive result.\n\n**Clues:** A chain of events leading to a negative outcome.

      { title: 'Causal Reasoning', text: 'Debates the *cause* of an observed event or phenomenon.\n\n**Clues:** The argument offers an **Alternative Explanation** ("Z caused Y, not X") or **Weakens a Causal Link** by showing the effect occurs without the cause.' },
      { title: 'Challenging an Assumption', text: 'Attacks the unstated belief (implicit premise) that is necessary for an argument\'s logic to work.\n\n**Clues:** The speaker doesn\'t attack the stated evidence but introduces a new fact that breaks the logical link between evidence and conclusion.' },
      { title: 'Applying Principles & Rules', text: 'Uses a general rule, definition, or principle to evaluate a specific case.\n\n**Clues:** Moves from a broad statement to a specific conclusion, or uses a specific example to establish a broad principle.' },
      { title: 'Process of Elimination', text: 'Reaches a conclusion by identifying a limited set of possibilities and systematically ruling out all but one.\n\n**Clues:** A list of options followed by reasons to discard each one. The conclusion is what\'s left.' },
      { title: 'Refutation by Counterexample', text: 'Disproves a general or universal claim by providing a single, specific instance where the claim is false.\n\n**Clues:** The argument targets absolute language ("all," "only," "never") and responds with a specific, factual case that violates the rule.' }

      '**Mischaracterization:** The answer choice correctly identifies a component of the argument but misrepresents what the speaker *does* with it. **To Avoid:** Focus on the *action verb* in the answer choice.',
      '**Valid Method, but Not the One Used:** The answer describes a legitimate logical strategy that simply wasn\'t used in the stimulus. **To Avoid:** Stick to your prephrase and confirm the stimulus *actually matches* the pattern described.',
      '**Mismatch in Logical Force:** The answer choice is too strong ("proves false") or too weak ("questions") for the argument. **To Avoid:** Pay attention to the certainty of the author\'s language.',
      '**Out of Scope:** The answer introduces an element not mentioned in the stimulus. **To Avoid:** If you can\'t point to it in the text, it\'s not the right answer.'
