      "**Nuanced Roles & Layered Arguments:** The author might not just present an analogy; they might critique an opponent's analogy by offering a *counter-analogy*, or defend a principle against a counterexample by *refining the principle*.",
      "**Formal & Counter-Intuitive Logic:** Some arguments hinge on sophisticated logical concepts that are harder to spot than a simple analogy, such as **Proof by Contradiction**, complex **Conditional Reasoning**, or subtle flaws in **Statistical or Proportional Reasoning**."

    { type: 'h3', text: '2. The Answer Choices Are Highly Abstract' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "The most common feature of difficult Method questions is the language of the answer choices. You might understand the stimulus perfectly, but the answer choices can feel dense and impenetrable." },

    { type: 'paragraph', text: "This requires you to recognize \"the story of the Kelton Company\" as a \"counterexample\" and \"Joanna's rule\" as a \"general claim.\" On the hardest questions, this abstraction is taken to an extreme." },
    { type: 'h3', text: '3. The Trap Answers Are More Sophisticated' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: "On hard questions, trap answers are designed to be extremely tempting by mirroring the structure of valid, but different, logical moves." },
    { type: 'list', items: [
      '**The "Plausible, but Not Precise" Trap:** A common trap will describe a legitimate logical strategy that is *similar* to the one used in the stimulus but misses a key nuance. For example, an argument might weaken a causal claim by showing the effect occurs *without* the cause, while a trap answer describes weakening a causal claim by showing a *third factor* caused both.',
      '**The "Mischaracterization" Trap:** This trap correctly identifies the topic but misdescribes what the author does with it, for instance, claiming the author is "questioning a premise" when they are actually "challenging an unstated assumption."',
      '**The "Too Strong" Trap:** This trap describes the method with an inappropriate level of certainty, saying the author "proves the claim is false" when they only "cast doubt on the claim."'
