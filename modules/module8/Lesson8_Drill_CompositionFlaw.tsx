  title: "Attacking Averages - The Composition Flaw (PT-103-S-3-Q-24)",
  content: [
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Arguments on the LSAT frequently use statistics like averages, percentages, and rates to support their conclusions. While these numbers seem objective and persuasive, they can be deeply misleading. High-difficulty questions often test your ability to look "under the hood" of a statistic and question what it truly represents. One of the most common statistical traps is the **Composition Flaw**.'},
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'This occurs when an argument discusses an "average" for a group but ignores the fact that the *composition* of that group has changed over time. If the mix of components changes, the average can change for reasons that have nothing to do with the author\'s conclusion. This drill will teach you to spot this flaw and weaken arguments that rely on these deceptive averages.'},

It shows that the composition of the group used to calculate the "average price" has changed. If individuals are now a smaller slice of the pie, it means that non-individual buyers (like corporations and governments) are a larger slice. If these non-individual buyers purchase more expensive vehicles on average, their increased presence in the market would drive up the *overall average price*, even if the prices paid by *individuals* have not changed at all.

        '**Look for a Changing Mix (The Composition Flaw):** The most effective way to attack a flawed average is to show that the composition of the group has changed over time. If a group is now composed of more of its "expensive" members, the average will go up, but this tells you nothing about the "cheaper" members.',
        '**Translate Statistics into Concrete Scenarios:** If you\'re struggling, make up numbers.\n*   **Past:** 90 individual sales ($20k) + 10 corporate sales ($50k) = Average of $23k.\n*   **Present:** 50 individual sales ($20k) + 50 corporate sales ($50k) = Average of $35k.\n*   The overall average has skyrocketed, but the price for individuals has remained exactly the same. This proves the author\'s logic is flawed.'
