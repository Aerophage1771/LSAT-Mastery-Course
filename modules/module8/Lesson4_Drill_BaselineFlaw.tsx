These arguments are often flawed because they ignore a crucial piece of information: the **baseline**. The baseline is the starting point of the participants. To prove value, an argument must show that the program *caused an improvement* from that baseline, not just that the participants ended up in a good place." },

        "**Distinguish Outcome from Value-Added:** The LSAT frequently tests your ability to separate the final *outcome* from the *value added* by a process. The dean presents an outcome (jobs) as proof of value. The correct answer shows that the value added was likely zero because the outcome was already achieved.",
        "**Spot \"Self-Selection\" Weakeners:** This is a form of selection bias. The people who \"selected\" this program were not a blank slate; they were a pre-selected group of already-employed professionals.
