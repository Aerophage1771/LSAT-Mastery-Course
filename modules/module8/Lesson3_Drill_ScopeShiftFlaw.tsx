Sometimes this is a massive leap, where an author switches from one concept to a completely different one. More often, however, the flaw is a subtle **Scope Shift**: the author provides evidence about a specific, narrow category and then draws a conclusion about a related but much broader one. This subtle difference in scope, often hidden in a single word, is a frequent source of error." },

      "**Avoid the \"How\" Trap:** Don't get distracted by answers like (A) that just talk about how the study was done (the methodology). They feel topical, but they aren't correct unless they flag a clear issue. Pointing out that a study was a \"review\" doesn't prove the logic is bad. A real weakener must explain **why** the evidence doesn't support the conclusion, not just describe the study's format."
