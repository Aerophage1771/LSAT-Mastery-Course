    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'In many causal arguments, the author observes a correlation between two phenomena, A and B, and concludes that A causes B. The most common way to weaken such an argument is to suggest a third, unmentioned factor, C, that is the true cause of B. However, high-difficulty questions often employ a more sophisticated and devastating type of weakener: **Reverse Causation**.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Instead of proposing an external cause, a Reverse Causal weakener argues that the author has the relationship backward. It\'s not that A causes B; it\'s that B actually causes A. This type of answer choice is powerful because it uses the same two elements from the stimulus but completely flips the logical structure, showing that the author has fundamentally misinterpreted the evidence.' },

The author assumes `Anger → High BP`. This choice states that the underlying `Physiological Factors → High BP` and those same `Physiological Factors → Anger`. In short, the medical condition causes the personality trait, not the other way around.

The core of the author\'s *new* evidence was the link between anger and permanent high blood pressure. The strongest weakener must attack this specific link.'
