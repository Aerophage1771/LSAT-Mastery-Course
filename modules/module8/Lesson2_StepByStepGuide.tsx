      '**Translate into Simple Terms:** Restate the argument\'s core logic in your own words using a ""*Since [Premise], therefore [Conclusion]*"" format. \n    *   *Example:* ""Since the author saw X happen after Y, they conclude that Y caused X."" This helps strip away ""fluff"" and exposes the underlying reasoning.'

      '**Categorize the Flaw:** Recognizing common patterns can help you spot the gap faster:\n    *   **Correlation vs. Causation:** The author assumes A caused B just because they happened together. **Weakener:** Show that C caused B, or that B actually caused A.\n    *   **Bad Analogy:** The author assumes two things are alike enough to treat them the same way. **Weakener:** Point out a fundamental difference between the two things.\n    *   **Unrepresentative Group:** The author draws a broad conclusion from a small, biased, or unusual data set. **Weakener:** Show why the sample doesn\'t represent the whole.\n    *   **Ignoring Side Effects:** The author recommends a plan but ignores a hidden cost or a reason why the plan won\'t work. **Weakener:** Introduce a negative consequence that outweighs the benefit.'
