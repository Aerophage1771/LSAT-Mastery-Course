An author sees a correlation between A and B and concludes A causes B; you weaken it by suggesting that an unmentioned factor, C, is the real cause. However, many causal arguments are vulnerable at a more fundamental stage. What happens when the evidence for the correlation itself is suspect?" },

In these cases, you aren't just looking for another cause for the effect; you are looking for a reason to doubt the numbers the author is using. We will learn to spot how a bias in the reporting of information can create a \"phantom correlation,\" making it seem like two things are linked when they are not." },

Here, the words \"asked\" and \"estimate\" were the keys. Because the evidence was subjective, the easiest way to break the argument was to show that the subjectivity itself created the result.",
      "**Recognize the Reporting Bias Weakener:** A \"Reporting Bias\" answer choice explains why the data in the premise looks the way it does without the conclusion being true. It shows that the \"Effect\" (headaches) is actually causing the \"Evidence\" (the overestimation of VDT use). This is a frequent high-level way to destroy a survey-based argument.",
      "**Critical Mindset for Gaps:** On the LSAT, you are not a passive reader. Because you know a Weaken question requires a gap, you should be actively searching for any reason why the premises might be misleading. If the author uses estimates or memories, your primary avenue for weakening should be to question the accuracy of those memories. Always be critical of \"soft\" data."
