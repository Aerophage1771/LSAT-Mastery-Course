They invert the standard task: instead of finding the one answer that weakens the argument, you must find the four answers that weaken it and select the one that is left over. The correct answer will be the choice that either **strengthens** the argument or is completely **irrelevant** to it.' },

The key to success is to have a crystal-clear understanding of the argument\'s core logic and to methodically test each answer choice against it. This drill will focus on a classic causal argument, where four choices will provide alternative explanations for an observed effect, leaving one that supports the author\'s original explanation.' },

Your job is to tick them off one by one. Anything that could also explain the effect (fewer deaths) is a weakener.',
        '**The "Odd One Out" is Your Answer:** The correct answer will be the one that breaks the pattern. It will not provide an alternative cause. In this case, it did the opposite: it provided a reason to believe the author\'s stated cause was actually true. This makes it a strengthener, and therefore the correct answer to a Weaken EXCEPT question.'
