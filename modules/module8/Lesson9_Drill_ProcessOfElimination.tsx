    { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Many arguments on the LSAT are built on a simple but powerful logical structure: **Process of Elimination**. The author presents a limited set of possibilities and then tries to prove one is correct by ruling out the others. These arguments often take the form, "The explanation must be either A or B. We have evidence that it isn\'t B. Therefore, it must be A."' },

High-difficulty Weaken questions often exploit this flaw. The most effective way to attack a Process of Elimination argument is to introduce a third, unconsidered possibility (Option C) that also explains the evidence. This shatters the author\'s limited framework and reveals their conclusion to be an unproven assumption.' },
